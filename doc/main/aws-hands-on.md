# 🧭 COMPLETE AWS EC2 HANDS-ON ROADMAP

## 🧪 EC2 HANDS-ON – LAB 1

### 👉 Launch Your First EC2 Instance (Free Tier – SAFE)

### 🎯 Objective

You will:

* Launch a **Free Tier EC2 instance**
* Understand **AMI, instance type, key pair, security group**
* Get a **public IP**

---

### 🧠 Before You Start (Very Important)

* Login to **Amazon Web Services Management Console**
* Make sure you are in **ONE region** (example: `ap-south-1 (Mumbai)`)

👉 **Region matters** because:

* EC2 runs inside a region
* Free tier limits are per region

---

### 🔹 STEP 1: Go to EC2 Dashboard

1. Login to AWS Console
2. In the **search bar**, type: `EC2`
3. Click **EC2**

📌 You are now inside the EC2 service

---

### 🔹 STEP 2: Click “Launch Instance”

1. Click **Launch Instance**
2. You will see a **Launch Instance** page

---

### 🔹 STEP 3: Name Your Instance

* Instance name:

  ```
  ec2-hands-on-1
  ```

📌 This is just a **label** to identify your server

---

### 🔹 STEP 4: Choose AMI (Operating System)

Select:

* **Amazon Linux 2023 AMI**

📌 Why?

* Free tier eligible
* Optimized for AWS
* Secure and lightweight

✅ Do **NOT** choose Ubuntu for now

---

### 🔹 STEP 5: Choose Instance Type

Select:

* **t2.micro**

📌 Why?

* 1 vCPU
* 1 GB RAM
* **FREE TIER ELIGIBLE**

⚠️ Anything else = billing risk

---

### 🔹 STEP 6: Create Key Pair (VERY IMPORTANT)

Key pair = **login password for your server**

1. Click **Create new key pair**
2. Key pair name:

   ```
   ec2-key-hands-on
   ```
3. Key pair type: **RSA**
4. Private key format: **.pem**
5. Click **Create key pair**

📌 A `.pem` file will download
⚠️ **DO NOT DELETE IT**
Without this, you **cannot login**

---

### 🔹 STEP 7: Configure Network Settings (Security Group)

Click **Edit** under Network settings

### Inbound rules (ALLOW ACCESS):

| Type | Port | Source   |
| ---- | ---- | -------- |
| SSH  | 22   | My IP    |
| HTTP | 80   | Anywhere |

📌 Explanation:

* **SSH (22)** → Login to EC2
* **HTTP (80)** → Web server access
* **My IP** → Secure (only your system)
* **Anywhere** → Public website access

---

### 🔹 STEP 8: Storage (Leave Default)

* 8 GiB (gp3) → Leave as it is

📌 Free tier allows up to **30 GB**

---

### 🔹 STEP 9: Launch Instance

1. Review everything
2. Click **Launch Instance**
3. Click **View all instances**

---

### 🔹 STEP 10: Verify Instance Status

Your instance state should be:

* 🟡 Initializing
* 🟢 **Running**

Click your instance and check:

* **Instance State** → Running
* **Public IPv4 address** → COPY IT

📌 This IP is your **server on the internet**

---

### ✅ TASK FOR YOU (DO THIS NOW)

✔ Launch EC2 instance
✔ Instance state = **Running**
✔ You can see **Public IPv4 address**

---


Excellent 👍
**LAB 1 completed successfully** ✅

## 🧪 EC2 HANDS-ON – LAB 2

### 👉 Connect to EC2 using SSH 

![Image](https://miro.medium.com/1%2AB6_U18PU0UYWOgbsDQbzxg.png)

![Image](https://cloudonaut.io/images/2022/02/ec2-ssh-ic-ssm.png)


---

### 🎯 Objective of This Lab

You will:

* Connect to your EC2 instance **from your Windows laptop**
* Understand **SSH**, **key pair**, **user**, **IP**
* Login **successfully** without fear or confusion

---

### 🧠 Important Concepts

Before doing steps, understand this:

### 🔹 What is SSH?

**SSH (Secure Shell)** is a secure way to:

* Connect your laptop → EC2 server
* Run commands on the server

Think like this:

> SSH = Remote control of your EC2 using text commands

---

### 🔹 What do we need for SSH?

We need **4 things**:

1. **Public IP** → Address of your EC2
2. **Key pair (.pem file)** → Password (but more secure)
3. **Username** → Depends on OS
4. **SSH command**

---

### 🔹 STEP 1: Open PowerShell (Windows)

1. Press **Windows key**
2. Type: `PowerShell`
3. Open **Windows PowerShell**

📌 Do **NOT** open CMD
PowerShell supports SSH by default

---

### 🔹 STEP 2: Go to Folder Where `.pem` File Exists

Your key file name:

```
ec2-key-hands-on.pem
```

Usually it is in **Downloads** folder.

### Run this command:

```powershell
cd Downloads
```

📌 Explanation:

* `cd` = change directory
* `Downloads` = folder name

To confirm file exists, run:

```powershell
ls
```

📌 `ls` shows list of files
You should see:

```
ec2-key-hands-on.pem
```

---

### 🔹 STEP 3: Copy Your EC2 Public IP

1. Go to EC2 Console
2. Click your instance
3. Copy **Public IPv4 address**

Example:

```
13.235.xxx.xxx
```

---

### 🔹 STEP 4: Understand the SSH Command (IMPORTANT)

### SSH command format:

```powershell
ssh -i keyfile.pem username@public-ip
```

Now replace values 👇

| Part      | Value                  |
| --------- | ---------------------- |
| keyfile   | `ec2-key-hands-on.pem` |
| username  | `ec2-user`             |
| public-ip | your EC2 IP            |

📌 **Why `ec2-user`?**
Because you selected **Amazon Linux AMI**

---

### 🔹 STEP 5: Connect to EC2 (RUN THIS)

```powershell
ssh -i ec2-key-hands-on.pem ec2-user@YOUR_PUBLIC_IP
```

Example:

```powershell
ssh -i ec2-key-hands-on.pem ec2-user@13.235.xxx.xxx
```

---

### 🔹 STEP 6: Type “yes” (First Time Only)

You will see:

```
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)?
```

Type:

```
yes
```

Press **Enter**

📌 This happens only once
It means: “I trust this server”

---

### 🎉 SUCCESS CHECK (VERY IMPORTANT)

If you see something like:

```
[ec2-user@ip-172-31-xx-xx ~]$
```

✅ **YOU ARE INSIDE EC2 SERVER**

This means:

* Your laptop → connected to AWS server
* SSH is working
* Key pair is correct

---

### 🔍 Verify You Are Really Inside EC2

Run:

```bash
whoami
```

Output should be:

```
ec2-user
```

Run:

```bash
pwd
```

Output:

```
/home/ec2-user
```

---


### ✅ TASK FOR YOU (LAB 2)

✔ Open PowerShell

✔ SSH into EC2

✔ See `[ec2-user@...]$` prompt

✔ Run `whoami`

---



## 🔑 What is a Key Pair in EC2? 

A **Key Pair** is like a **lock and key** 🔐

* **Public key** → Stored inside the EC2 instance (AWS keeps it)
* **Private key** → Downloaded by **you** (file like `.pem` or `.ppk`)

This key pair is used to **log in securely** to your EC2 instance.

👉 **Without a key pair, you CANNOT login to EC2**

---

### 🧭 When You Create a Key Pair – What Options You See

When you click **Create new key pair**, AWS shows **2 main options**:

![Image](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20230309161715/IMG_20230309_161526-768.png)

---

### 1️⃣ Key Pair Type

You will see **two options**:

### 🔹 RSA (Most common ✅)

* Old but very stable
* Supported everywhere
* Default choice

👉 **Use this if you are a beginner**

### 🔹 ED25519

* Newer & more secure
* Faster
* Not supported by some old systems

👉 Use this **only if you clearly know you need it**

✅ **Recommended for you:** `RSA`

---

### 2️⃣ Private Key File Format (MOST IMPORTANT)

This is where people get confused 👇

You will see **two options**:

---

### 🔹 `.pem` file (Linux / Mac / Git Bash)

**Use this when:**

* EC2 OS is **Amazon Linux / Ubuntu**
* You connect using:

  * Git Bash
  * MobaXterm
  * Mac Terminal
  * Linux Terminal


---

### 🔹 `.ppk` file (Windows – PuTTY)

**Use this when:**

* You use **PuTTY** on Windows
* You don’t want to convert `.pem` to `.ppk`

Used directly in **PuTTY → Auth → Private key file**

---

### 🧠 Very Important Rule (Remember This)

| Your Tool            | Choose This |
| -------------------- | ----------- |
| Git Bash / MobaXterm | `.pem`      |
| Mac / Linux Terminal | `.pem`      |
| PuTTY (Windows)      | `.ppk`      |

👉 If confused → **Always choose `.pem`**
You can later convert `.pem → .ppk`, but not easily the other way.

---

### ❗ IMPORTANT WARNINGS (Real-life mistakes)

⚠️ **Download key only ONCE**

* AWS will **never show it again**
* If you lose it → You lose access

⚠️ **Do NOT share your private key**

* Anyone with this file can access your server

⚠️ **Do NOT upload key to GitHub**

* This is a serious security risk

---

### 🧠 Short Memory Trick

> **Linux server = `.pem`**
> **PuTTY user = `.ppk`**

---



## 🔐 What “Key Pair” Means Internally (Big Picture)

An EC2 key pair uses **asymmetric encryption**.

That means:

* 🔑 **Public Key** → stored on the EC2 server
* 🗝️ **Private Key** → stored ONLY with you
* They work **together**, not separately

Think of it like:

> **Public key = Lock**
> **Private key = Only key that can open that lock**

---

### 🧠 Step-by-Step: What Happens Internally


![Image](https://comodosslstore.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/public-key-vs-private-key.png)



### When EC2 instance is launched:

* The **public key** is copied into the server file:

```text
~/.ssh/authorized_keys
```

This file lives **inside the EC2 instance**.

👉 This file decides **who is allowed to log in**.

---

### 🟢 You try to connect (SSH)

You run:

```bash
ssh -i mykey.pem ec2-user@<public-ip>
```

What happens internally:

1. You say: *“Hey server, I want to login”*
2. Server says: *“Prove you are authorized”*

---

### 🟢 Server sends a challenge 🔒

The EC2 server:

* Creates a **random encrypted message**
* Encrypts it using the **public key**
* Sends it to your system

⚠️ Important:

* **Only the matching private key can decrypt it**

---

### 🟢 Step 5: Your private key responds 🔓

Your computer:

* Uses your **private key**
* Decrypts the message
* Sends the correct response back

---

### 🟢 Step 6: Server verifies and allows login ✅

Server checks:

* “Does this response match what I expected?”

If **YES**:

* Login allowed 🎉

If **NO**:

* ❌ Permission denied

---

### 🔄 Internal Flow (Very Simple)

```
You (Private Key)
        ↓
Decrypt challenge
        ↓
Send proof
        ↓
EC2 checks using Public Key
        ↓
Login allowed
```

---

### 🔐 Why Password Is NOT Used

EC2 does **NOT** use passwords by default because:

❌ Passwords can be:

* Brute-forced
* Stolen
* Guessed

✅ Keys are:

* Very long
* Mathematically linked
* Impossible to guess

---

### 🔥 What If Someone Gets Public Key?

Nothing happens.

✔️ Public key:

* Can be shared
* Is useless without private key

❌ Private key:

* MUST be protected
* Gives full access

---

### 🧨 What If You Lose the Private Key?

Internally:

* Server has the public key
* You don’t have the private key
* Authentication fails forever ❌

Result:

* You cannot login
* You must:

  * Detach root volume
  * Attach to another EC2
  * Add a new public key manually


---

### 🧠 One-Line Summary (Interview Ready)

> **EC2 uses SSH key-based authentication where the public key is stored on the server and the private key proves the client’s identity without ever being sent over the network.**

---

### 🧪 Real-World Analogy

* Public key → Lock on your house
* Private key → Actual key in your pocket
* SSH login → Trying to open the door

---

## 🧪 EC2 HANDS-ON – LAB 3

### 👉 Install Apache Web Server & Host Your First Website

![Image](https://miro.medium.com/1%2AUdXC594q9XxYneb4yqze_A.png)

---

### 🎯 Objective of This Lab

You will:

* Install **Apache (httpd)** on EC2
* Start the web server
* Host a simple web page
* Access it using **browser + public IP**

---

### 🧠 Important Concept (Simple Words)

### 🔹 What is Apache?

**Apache (httpd)** is a **web server**.

Meaning:

* It listens on **port 80**
* When someone opens your IP in browser
* Apache sends a **web page**

---

### 🔹 STEP 1: Update Your EC2 Server

Run this command:

```bash
sudo dnf update -y
```

📌 Explanation:

* `sudo` → run command as admin (root)
* `dnf` → package manager (like Play Store)
* `update` → update system packages
* `-y` → auto-approve (no questions)

---

### 🔹 STEP 2: Install Apache (httpd)

Run:

```bash
sudo dnf install httpd -y
```

📌 Explanation:

* `install` → install software
* `httpd` → Apache web server package

---

### 🔹 STEP 3: Start Apache Server

```bash
sudo systemctl start httpd
```

📌 Explanation:

* `systemctl` → service manager
* `start` → start service
* `httpd` → Apache service

---

### 🔹 STEP 4: Enable Apache on Boot (VERY IMPORTANT)

```bash
sudo systemctl enable httpd
```

📌 Why?

* If EC2 restarts
* Apache starts automatically

---

### 🔹 STEP 5: Check Apache Status

```bash
sudo systemctl status httpd
```

You should see:

```
Active: active (running)
```

Press:

```
q
```

to exit status screen

---

### 🔹 STEP 6: Test in Browser (BIG MOMENT 🎉)

1. Copy your **EC2 Public IP**
2. Open browser
3. Paste:

```
http://YOUR_PUBLIC_IP
```

### Expected Result:

🟢 **Apache Test Page**

✅ This means:

* EC2 is running
* Apache is working
* Security group allows HTTP (port 80)

---

### 🔹 STEP 7: Create Your Own Web Page

Apache default folder:

```
/var/www/html
```

### Go to folder:

```bash
cd /var/www/html
```

---

### 🔹 STEP 8: Create HTML File

```bash
sudo nano index.html
```

📌 `nano` = simple text editor

Paste this:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>My First EC2 Website</title>
</head>
<body>
  <h1>Hello from EC2 🚀</h1>
  <p>Apache Web Server is working!</p>
</body>
</html>
```

### Save & Exit:

* Press **CTRL + X**
* Press **Y**
* Press **Enter**

---

### 🔹 STEP 9: Refresh Browser

Open again:

```
http://YOUR_PUBLIC_IP
```

🎉 You should see **your own website**

---

### 🛑 COMMON ISSUE CHECK

If page does not open:

* Check **Security Group → HTTP (80) allowed**
* Instance state = **Running**
* Apache status = **active**

---

### ✅ TASK FOR YOU (LAB 3)

✔ Apache installed
✔ Apache running
✔ Custom HTML page created
✔ Website opens using public IP

---

## 🧪 EC2 HANDS-ON – LAB 4

### 👉 Elastic IP (Static Public IP) – No More IP Changes

![Image](https://www.turnkeylinux.org/files/images/01_Elastic_IP_addresses_EC2_Console.png)

---

### 🎯 Objective of This Lab

You will:

* Understand **why public IP changes**
* Create an **Elastic IP (EIP)**
* Attach it to your EC2 instance
* Access your website using a **fixed IP**

---

### 🧠 Why Public IP Changes? (Simple Explanation)

>Because the public IP is temporary unless you reserve it.

- AWS gives you a temporary public IP by default.

- When the instance stops and restarts, that IP is taken back by AWS.

❌ Bad for:

* Websites
* APIs
* Domain mapping
 
### 🚨 IMPORTANT RULE (Remember This)

|Action	| Public IP|
|---	|---|
|Reboot EC2 |	❌ Does NOT change|
|Stop EC2 |	✅ Changes|
|Terminate EC2 |	❌ Instance gone|
|Start EC2 |	✅ New IP|

---

💰 Cost:
👉 ~$0.005 per hour per Elastic IP

### 🧠 What is Elastic IP?

**Elastic IP (EIP)** is:

* A **static public IPv4 address**
* Belongs to **your AWS account**
* You can attach/detach to EC2

Think like:

> Elastic IP = Permanent phone number 📱
> Public IP = Temporary number

---

### ⚠️ Cost Warning (IMPORTANT)

* **Free** when attached to **running EC2**
* **Charged** if:

  * Not attached
  * Instance stopped

👉 We will keep it **attached**

---

### 🔹 STEP 1: Go to Elastic IPs

1. Open **EC2 Console**
2. Left menu → **Elastic IPs**
3. Click **Allocate Elastic IP address**

---

### 🔹 STEP 2: Allocate Elastic IP

* Network border group → **Leave default**
* Click **Allocate**

You will now see a new **Elastic IP**

---

### 🔹 STEP 3: Associate Elastic IP to EC2

1. Select Elastic IP
2. Click **Actions → Associate Elastic IP**
3. Resource type → **Instance**
4. Instance → select `ec2-hands-on-1`
5. Click **Associate**

---

### 🔹 STEP 4: Verify Association

* Elastic IP shows:

  * Instance ID
  * Private IP

Your EC2 now has:

* **Static public IP**

---

### 🔹 STEP 5: Test Website Using Elastic IP

Open browser:

```
http://ELASTIC_IP
```

🟢 Your website should load

---

### 🔹 STEP 6: Confirm IP Stability (Understanding)

If you:

* Restart EC2 ❌ (DON’T DO NOW)
* Elastic IP **will NOT change**

---

### 🛑 IMPORTANT RULE

If you ever:

* **Terminate EC2**
  👉 First **release Elastic IP**
  Otherwise AWS will charge

---

### ✅ TASK FOR YOU (LAB 4)

✔ Elastic IP allocated
✔ Elastic IP associated to EC2
✔ Website opens using Elastic IP

---

## 🧪 EC2 HANDS-ON – LAB 5

### 👉 Attach a Domain to EC2 using Route 53 (Real-World Hosting)

![Image](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize%3Afit%3A1200/1%2ArusHUrFBnPFcD6esjWZB1Q.png)

---

### 🎯 Objective of This Lab

You will:

* Understand **DNS & Domain flow**
* Create a **Hosted Zone** in Route 53
* Map your **Elastic IP → Domain**
* Open your website using a **domain name** 🎉

---

### 🧠 First: Understand the Flow (VERY IMPORTANT)

When someone types:

```
www.example.com
```

What happens?

1. Browser asks **DNS**
2. DNS replies → **Elastic IP**
3. Elastic IP points → **EC2**
4. Apache sends the website

👉 **Route 53 = DNS service**

---

### 🧠 What is Route 53?

**Amazon Route 53** is:

* AWS DNS service
* Converts **domain → IP address**
* Highly available & fast

---

### ⚠️ IMPORTANT NOTE (READ CAREFULLY)

There are **TWO CASES**:

#### ✅ Case 1: You already bought a domain

(from GoDaddy / Namecheap / Route 53)

→ Continue with this lab

#### ❌ Case 2: You don’t have a domain yet

→ You can still **practice** using a fake domain name
(no website will open publicly, but concept is same)

I’ll explain **both safely**.

---

### 🔹 STEP 1: Open Route 53

1. AWS Console → search **Route 53**
2. Open **Route 53**
3. Click **Hosted zones**
4. Click **Create hosted zone**

---

### 🔹 STEP 2: Create Hosted Zone

#### Fill details:

* **Domain name**
  Example:

  ```
  devcloudpractice.com
  ```

* **Type**
  → **Public Hosted Zone**

Click **Create hosted zone**

📌 Hosted Zone = DNS control panel for your domain

---

### 🔹 STEP 3: Understand Name Servers (CRITICAL)

After creation, you’ll see **4 NS records**, like:

```
ns-123.awsdns-45.com
ns-678.awsdns-90.net
...
```

📌 These are **AWS DNS servers**

---

### 🔹 STEP 4: Update Name Servers (Only if Domain Bought Outside AWS)

If your domain is from:

* GoDaddy
* Namecheap
* Hostinger

#### Go to domain provider:

1. Open DNS / Nameserver settings
2. Replace existing name servers
3. Paste **Route 53 name servers**
4. Save

⏳ DNS propagation: **5–30 minutes (sometimes 24 hrs)**

⚠️ If domain bought from Route 53 → **skip this step**

---

### 🔹 STEP 5: Create A Record (Domain → EC2)

Inside Hosted Zone:

1. Click **Create record**
2. Record type → **A**
3. Record name:

   * Leave empty → root domain
     (`example.com`)
4. Value:

   * Paste **Elastic IP**
5. TTL → default
6. Click **Create records**

📌 A record = maps domain → IP

---

### 🔹 STEP 6: (Optional) Create www Record

Create another record:

* Record name:

  ```
  www
  ```
* Type → A
* Value → Elastic IP

This enables:

```
www.example.com
```

---

### 🔹 STEP 7: Test Your Domain 🎉

Open browser:

```
http://yourdomain.com
```

or

```
http://www.yourdomain.com
```

🟢 Your EC2 website should load

---

### 🧠 Real-World Knowledge (Interview Ready)

✔ Route 53 does **not host websites**
✔ It only does **DNS resolution**
✔ EC2 + Apache hosts the website
✔ Elastic IP ensures static mapping

---

### 🛑 Common Issues Checklist

| Issue            | Fix                      |
| ---------------- | ------------------------ |
| Site not opening | Wait DNS propagation     |
| IP wrong         | Check Elastic IP         |
| Apache down      | `systemctl status httpd` |
| HTTP blocked     | Security Group port 80   |

---

### ✅ TASK FOR YOU (LAB 5)

✔ Hosted Zone created
✔ A record added
✔ Domain mapped to Elastic IP

---

## 🔐 EC2 Security Group – SSH, Ports, and IP Access 

---

### 1️⃣ What is a Security Group in EC2?

* A **Security Group** is a **virtual firewall**
* It controls:

  * **Who can reach your EC2 instance**
  * **On which port**
* It works at **network level (before login)**

👉 If traffic is **not allowed** by Security Group → EC2 never receives it.

---

### 2️⃣ What does `0.0.0.0/0` mean?

```
0.0.0.0/0 = ANY IP address on the internet
```

⚠️ This means **publicly open to the world**.

---

### 3️⃣ What does “My IP” mean?

When you select **My IP**, AWS:

* Detects your **current public internet IP**
* Sets the rule as:

```
x.x.x.x/32
```

`/32` means:

* Only **ONE exact IP**
* Only **your current network**

👉 This is **secure and recommended**.

---

### 4️⃣ Understanding the 3 Important Ports

#### 🔐 Port 22 – SSH

**Used for:**

* Remote login to EC2
* Full server control (admin access)

**What SSH gives:**

* File access
* Command execution
* Full OS control

👉 **This is the most sensitive port**

---

#### 🌐 Port 80 – HTTP

**Used for:**

* Website access via browser
* Public web traffic

**What HTTP gives:**

* Only what your application exposes
* No OS access
* No command execution

👉 **Designed to be public**

---

#### ⚙️ Port 8080 – Application Port

**Used for:**

* Spring Boot
* Node.js
* Test applications

**Access level:**

* Application only
* Not OS-level

👉 Safe for testing, risky if admin APIs are exposed

---

### 5️⃣ Why ONLY SSH is dangerous when open to `0.0.0.0/0`

#### Key reason:

> **SSH provides full administrative access to the server**

Comparison:

| Port      | Access Type      | Risk        |
| --------- | ---------------- | ----------- |
| 22 (SSH)  | Full OS control  | 🔥 Very High |
| 80 (HTTP) | Web content only | 🟢 Low       |
| 8080      | App-level access | 🟡 Medium    |

👉 **Admin access should never be public**

---

### 6️⃣ What happens if SSH is set to `0.0.0.0/0`

#### Important clarification:

❌ Anyone **CANNOT login without `.pem` key**

✅ Anyone **CAN try to connect**

#### What attackers can do:

* Scan your public IP
* Detect open port 22
* Attempt:

  * Usernames
  * Stolen keys
  * Brute-force attacks

Even if they fail:

* Continuous attack attempts
* Log flooding
* Resource usage
* High security risk

---

### 7️⃣ Two Levels of EC2 Security (Very Important)

#### Level 1️⃣: Security Group (Network Gate)

* Controls **who can reach the port**

#### Level 2️⃣: SSH Authentication (Login Lock)

* Requires:

  * Correct username
  * Correct private key (`.pem`)

👉 `0.0.0.0/0` opens the **gate**, not the **lock**

---

### 8️⃣ Why `.pem` key is still required

* EC2 uses **key-based authentication**
* Password login is disabled by default
* Private key is never sent over the network

So:

* ❌ No `.pem` → No login
* ❌ Even AWS can’t login without it

---

### 9️⃣ Recommended Safe Configuration

| Port      | Source                | Status           |
| --------- | --------------------- | ---------------- |
| 22 (SSH)  | My IP                 | ✅ Secure         |
| 80 (HTTP) | 0.0.0.0/0             | ✅ Required       |
| 8080      | 0.0.0.0/0 (temporary) | ⚠️ OK for testing |

---

### 🔐 Golden Security Rule (Must Remember)

> **Never expose administrative access (SSH) to the public internet.**

* SSH → restrict to your IP
* HTTP/HTTPS → public
* App ports → open only if needed


---

### 🎯 Interview-Ready One-Line Answer

> **Opening SSH to 0.0.0.0/0 allows anyone on the internet to attempt connections, increasing attack risk. SSH must be restricted to trusted IPs, while HTTP is designed for public access.**

## 🧪 EC2 HANDS-ON – LAB 6

### 👉 Security Groups (Inbound & Outbound Rules – Deep Hands-On)

![Image](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/vpc/latest/userguide/images/security-group-referencing.png)


---

### 🎯 Objective of LAB 6

By the end of this lab, you will:

* **Create & modify Security Group rules**
* Understand **Inbound vs Outbound**
* Prove that **Security Groups are STATEFUL**
* Be able to **explain this confidently in interviews**

---

### 🧠 FIRST: What is a Security Group? (Very Simple)

A **Security Group (SG)** is:

* A **virtual firewall**
* Controls **who can access your EC2**
* Works at **instance level**

Think like this:

> Security Group = Security guard at the door 🚪
> Only allowed people can enter

---

### 🧠 IMPORTANT RULE (MEMORIZE)

❗ Security Groups:

* ✅ Allow rules only
* ❌ No deny rules
* ✅ Are **STATEFUL**

We will **prove this practically**.

---

### 🔹 STEP 1: Open Your EC2 Security Group

1. AWS Console → **EC2**
2. Click **Instances**
3. Select your instance `ec2-hands-on-1`
4. Go to **Security** tab
5. Click the **Security group name**

You are now inside **Security Group settings**

---

### 🔹 STEP 2: Understand Existing Inbound Rules

You should already see something like:

| Type | Port | Source   |
| ---- | ---- | -------- |
| SSH  | 22   | My IP    |
| HTTP | 80   | Anywhere |

#### What this means:

* SSH → You can connect from your laptop
* HTTP → Anyone can open your website

---

### 🔹 STEP 3: TEST 1 – Remove HTTP Access (Hands-On Proof)

#### ❌ Remove HTTP Rule

1. Click **Edit inbound rules**
2. ❌ Delete **HTTP (port 80)**
3. Click **Save rules**

---

#### 🔍 TEST IN BROWSER

Open:

```
http://ELASTIC_IP
```

#### Expected Result:

❌ Website **WILL NOT OPEN**

✅ This proves:

* Security Group **controls traffic**
* Port 80 is required for web access

---

### 🔹 STEP 4: Add HTTP Rule Back

1. **Edit inbound rules**
2. Add rule:

| Setting | Value                |
| ------- | -------------------- |
| Type    | HTTP                 |
| Port    | 80                   |
| Source  | Anywhere (0.0.0.0/0) |

3. **Save rules**

🔁 Refresh browser

#### Result:

🟢 Website opens again

---

### 🔹 STEP 5: TEST 2 – Change SSH Source (IMPORTANT)

#### ❌ Break SSH Access (on purpose)

1. Edit inbound rules
2. Change **SSH source** from:

```
My IP
```

to:

```
0.0.0.0/0
```

3. Save

📌 Meaning:

* Anyone on internet can try SSH (❌ unsafe)

⚠️ We will fix it later

---

### 🔹 STEP 6: Understand INBOUND vs OUTBOUND

#### Inbound Rules

👉 Who can **come IN** to EC2
Examples:

* SSH (22)
* HTTP (80)

---

#### Outbound Rules

👉 Where EC2 can **go OUT**

Default outbound rule:

```
All traffic → 0.0.0.0/0
```

📌 Means:

* EC2 can access internet
* Install updates
* Download packages

---

### 🔹 STEP 7: STATEFUL PROOF (VERY IMPORTANT)

Security Groups are **STATEFUL**.

#### What does that mean?

If:

* Inbound request is allowed
  Then:
* Response is **automatically allowed**
  (No outbound rule needed)

📌 Example:

* Browser → EC2 (HTTP allowed)
* EC2 → Browser (response allowed automatically)

💡 This is **interview GOLD**

---

### 🔹 STEP 8: FIX SECURITY (BEST PRACTICE)

Now make SSH secure again 👇

1. Edit inbound rules
2. Change SSH source back to:

```
My IP
```

3. Save

✅ Your EC2 is secure again

---

### 🧠 INTERVIEW-READY ANSWER (MEMORIZE)

> **Security Group** is a stateful virtual firewall that controls inbound and outbound traffic at the EC2 instance level. It supports only allow rules, and responses to allowed inbound traffic are automatically permitted.

---

### ✅ LAB 6 TASK CHECKLIST

✔ Removed HTTP and tested
✔ Added HTTP and tested
✔ Understood inbound vs outbound
✔ Proved **STATEFUL behavior**
✔ Secured SSH again

---

## 🧪 EC2 HANDS-ON – LAB 7

### 👉 Network ACL (NACL) vs Security Group (Hands-On + Deep Clarity)

![Image](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/vpc/latest/userguide/images/network-acl.png)

---

### 🎯 Objective of LAB 7

By the end of this lab, you will:

* Create & modify a **Network ACL**
* See how it works at **subnet level**
* **PROVE** it is **STATELESS**
* Understand **NACL vs Security Group** (interview-ready)

---

### 🧠 FIRST: What is a Network ACL? (Simple Words)

A **Network ACL (NACL)** is:

* A **firewall for a subnet**
* Works **before traffic reaches EC2**
* Applies to **ALL instances** in that subnet

Think like:

> NACL = Security gate at society entrance 🏢
> Security Group = Guard at each flat 🚪

---

### 🧠 VERY IMPORTANT RULES (MEMORIZE)

| Feature | NACL                    |
| ------- | ----------------------- |
| Level   | Subnet                  |
| Rules   | **Allow + Deny**        |
| Nature  | **STATELESS**           |
| Order   | Rule number (100, 110…) |
| Default | Allow all               |

---

### 🔹 STEP 1: Open Network ACLs

1. AWS Console → **VPC**
2. Left menu → **Network ACLs**
3. You will see a **default NACL**

---

### 🔹 STEP 2: Identify Your Subnet

1. Go to **EC2 → Instances**
2. Click your instance
3. Note **Subnet ID**

📌 We will apply NACL to **this subnet**

---

### 🔹 STEP 3: Create Custom NACL

1. VPC → Network ACLs
2. Click **Create network ACL**
3. Name:

   ```
   ec2-hands-on-nacl
   ```
4. Select your **VPC**
5. Click **Create**

---

### 🔹 STEP 4: Associate NACL with Subnet

1. Select your new NACL
2. Go to **Subnet associations**
3. Click **Edit subnet associations**
4. Select your EC2 subnet
5. Save

⚠️ This NACL now controls traffic for your EC2

---

### 🔹 STEP 5: BLOCK HTTP Using NACL (Hands-On Proof)

> Inbound Rule – DENY HTTP

1. Select **Inbound rules**
2. Click **Edit inbound rules**
3. Add rule:

| Rule # | Type | Port | Source    | Action   |
| ------ | ---- | ---- | --------- | -------- |
| 100    | HTTP | 80   | 0.0.0.0/0 | **DENY** |

4. Save

---

> 🔍 TEST IN BROWSER

Open:

```
http://ELASTIC_IP
```

❌ Website **WILL NOT OPEN**

📌 Even though:

* Security Group allows HTTP
* NACL denies it

👉 **NACL blocks first**

---

### 🔹 STEP 6: ALLOW HTTP Again

Add **ALLOW rule** with higher priority:

| Rule # | Type | Port | Source    | Action    |
| ------ | ---- | ---- | --------- | --------- |
| 90     | HTTP | 80   | 0.0.0.0/0 | **ALLOW** |

📌 Rule **90 runs before 100**

🔁 Refresh browser → 🟢 Works

---

### 🔹 STEP 7: PROVE STATELESS BEHAVIOR (IMPORTANT)

> ❌ Remove Outbound Rule

1. Go to **Outbound rules**
2. Delete rule:

```
ALLOW ALL (0.0.0.0/0)
```

3. Save

---

> 🔍 Test Website Again

❌ Website **WILL NOT LOAD**

📌 Why?

* Inbound allowed
* Outbound response blocked

👉 This **PROVES NACL is STATELESS**

---

### 🔹 STEP 8: FIX OUTBOUND RULE (IMPORTANT)

Add outbound rule:

| Rule # | Type | Port | Destination | Action |
| ------ | ---- | ---- | ----------- | ------ |
| 100    | HTTP | 80   | 0.0.0.0/0   | ALLOW  |

Also add:

| Rule # | Type  | Port | Destination | Action |
| ------ | ----- | ---- | ----------- | ------ |
| 110    | HTTPS | 443  | 0.0.0.0/0   | ALLOW  |

Save

---

### 🔹 STEP 9: FINAL COMPARISON (INTERVIEW TABLE)

| Feature    | Security Group | NACL          |
| ---------- | -------------- | ------------- |
| Level      | Instance       | Subnet        |
| Rules      | Allow only     | Allow + Deny  |
| Nature     | **Stateful**   | **Stateless** |
| Rule Order | No order       | Number based  |
| Scope      | Specific EC2   | All in subnet |

---

### 🧠 INTERVIEW-READY ANSWER

> Security Groups act as a stateful firewall at the instance level allowing only permitted traffic, whereas Network ACLs operate at the subnet level, are stateless, and support both allow and deny rules evaluated in order.

---

### ⚠️ CLEANUP (VERY IMPORTANT)

To avoid confusion later:

* Either **restore default NACL**
* Or keep both inbound & outbound properly allowed

---

### ✅ LAB 7 TASK CHECKLIST

✔ Created custom NACL
✔ Associated subnet
✔ Denied & allowed HTTP
✔ Proved stateless behavior
✔ Understood SG vs NACL clearly

## 🧪 EC2 HANDS-ON – LAB 8

### 👉 EC2 Key Pairs (Create, Use, Delete & Recover Access)

![Image](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/images/ec2-key-pair.png)

---

### 🎯 Objective of LAB 8

You will:

* Understand **what a key pair really is**
* Create & attach **new key pairs**
* Know **what happens if key is deleted**
* Learn **key recovery concept** (very important)

---

### 🧠 FIRST: What is an EC2 Key Pair?

A **Key Pair** has:

* **Public key** → Stored in EC2
* **Private key (.pem)** → Stored on your laptop

Think like:

> Lock (public key) is on server 🔒
> Key (private key) is with you 🔑

AWS **never stores private key**.

---

### 🔹 STEP 1: View Existing Key Pair

1. EC2 Console → **Key Pairs**
2. You will see:

```
ec2-key-hands-on
```

📌 AWS only shows **key name**, not the file

---

### 🔹 STEP 2: Create a SECOND Key Pair

1. Click **Create key pair**
2. Name:

```
ec2-key-backup
```

3. Type: **RSA**
4. Format: **.pem**
5. Create & download

📌 This is for **learning purpose**

---

### 🔹 STEP 3: Understand a CRITICAL RULE

❗ You **cannot** directly change key pair of:

* Running instance
* Stopped instance

Key pair is:

* Injected **at launch time**

---

### 🔹 STEP 4: What Happens If Key is Deleted? (Concept)

> Scenario:

* `.pem` file deleted from laptop ❌
* EC2 still running

> Result:

❌ You are **LOCKED OUT**

AWS **cannot recover it**

---

### 🔹 STEP 5: HOW TO RECOVER ACCESS (IMPORTANT CONCEPT)

There are **3 real-world recovery methods**:

---

> 🟢 Method 1: EC2 Instance Connect (AWS Linux only)

* Works only if:

  * Instance supports it
  * Port 22 allowed
* Temporary access

---

> 🟢 Method 2: Detach Root Volume (MOST COMMON)

Steps (conceptual):

1. Stop instance
2. Detach root EBS
3. Attach it to another EC2
4. Add new public key to:

```
~/.ssh/authorized_keys
```

5. Reattach volume
6. Start instance

📌 **Very important interview topic**

---

> 🟢 Method 3: Session Manager (BEST PRACTICE)

* Uses **IAM Role**
* No SSH, no key pair
* Secure & auditable

We’ll do this **hands-on later**

---

### 🔹 STEP 6: BEST PRACTICES (MEMORIZE)

✔ Always keep backup key
✔ Use **IAM Roles + Session Manager**
✔ Never share `.pem`
✔ Restrict SSH source
✔ Rotate keys in production

---

### 🧠 INTERVIEW-READY ANSWER

> An EC2 key pair consists of a public key stored on the instance and a private key held by the user. AWS does not store the private key, and if it is lost, access must be recovered through volume attachment or Session Manager.

---

### 🛑 DO NOT TRY KEY RECOVERY NOW

We will do it safely in **advanced labs**.

---

### ✅ LAB 8 TASK CHECKLIST

✔ Understood key pair concept
✔ Created backup key
✔ Learned recovery methods
✔ Understood best practices

---

## 🧪 EC2 HANDS-ON – LAB 9

### 👉 EC2 User Data (Automatic Setup at Launch)

![Image](https://cloudkatha.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/How-to-use-EC2-User-Data-Script-to-Install-Apache-Web-Server.png)


---

### 🎯 Objective of LAB 9

By the end of this lab, you will:

* Understand **what User Data is**
* Use User Data to **auto-install Apache**
* Deploy a website **WITHOUT SSH**
* Learn **cloud-init concept** (interview topic)

---

### 🧠 FIRST: What is EC2 User Data? (Very Simple)

**User Data** is:

* A **script** that runs **only once**
* Runs **when EC2 starts for the first time**
* Used for **automation**

Think like:

> User Data = Auto-setup instructions for EC2 🧠

Example:

* Install Apache
* Start service
* Create website
* Configure app

---

### 🧠 VERY IMPORTANT RULES (MEMORIZE)

❗ User Data:

* Runs **only at first launch**
* Runs as **root user**
* Uses **cloud-init**
* Best for **bootstrapping**

---

### 🔹 WHAT WE WILL DO (PLAN)

We will:

1. Launch **NEW EC2 instance**
2. Add **User Data script**
3. Apache installs automatically
4. Website works **without SSH**

---

### 🔹 STEP 1: Launch a NEW EC2 Instance

Go to:
**EC2 → Instances → Launch instance**

> Instance name:

```
ec2-userdata-demo
```

---

### 🔹 STEP 2: Choose AMI & Instance Type

* AMI → **Amazon Linux 2023**
* Instance type → **t2.micro (Free tier)**

---

### 🔹 STEP 3: Select Key Pair

Choose:

```
ec2-key-hands-on
```

(We won’t SSH, but AWS requires it)

---

### 🔹 STEP 4: Network & Security Group

Inbound rules:

| Type | Port | Source   |
| ---- | ---- | -------- |
| HTTP | 80   | Anywhere |
| SSH  | 22   | My IP    |

---

### 🔹 STEP 5: ADD USER DATA (MOST IMPORTANT)

Scroll down → **Advanced details**

Find:

> 👉 User data

Paste **EXACTLY** this:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
dnf update -y
dnf install httpd -y
systemctl start httpd
systemctl enable httpd

echo "<h1>Hello from EC2 User Data 🚀</h1>" > /var/www/html/index.html
```

---

### 🧠 EXPLAIN SCRIPT LINE BY LINE (IMPORTANT)

```bash
#!/bin/bash
```

➡ Tells EC2: “This is a Linux shell script”

```bash
dnf update -y
```

➡ Updates system packages

```bash
dnf install httpd -y
```

➡ Installs Apache web server

```bash
systemctl start httpd
```

➡ Starts Apache

```bash
systemctl enable httpd
```

➡ Starts Apache on reboot

```bash
echo "<h1>Hello from EC2 User Data 🚀</h1>" > /var/www/html/index.html
```

➡ Creates website homepage automatically

---

### 🔹 STEP 6: Launch Instance

Click **Launch instance**

Wait until:
🟢 Instance state → **Running**

---

### 🔹 STEP 7: Test WITHOUT SSH (BIG MOMENT 🎉)

1. Copy **Public IP**
2. Open browser:

```
http://PUBLIC_IP
```

> Expected Output:

```
Hello from EC2 User Data 🚀
```

✅ Apache installed
✅ Website deployed
✅ **No manual work**

---

### 🔹 STEP 8: Verify User Data Ran (Optional SSH)

If you want to check logs:

```bash
sudo cat /var/log/cloud-init-output.log
```

📌 Shows user data execution logs

---

### 🧠 INTERVIEW-READY ANSWER

> EC2 User Data is a cloud-init based mechanism that allows running scripts at instance launch to automate configuration such as installing software and starting services. It runs only once at first boot.

---

### ⚠️ COMMON MISTAKES (VERY IMPORTANT)

❌ Forget `#!/bin/bash`
❌ Wrong indentation
❌ Expecting script to run again after reboot
❌ Missing HTTP rule in SG

---

### ✅ LAB 9 TASK CHECKLIST

- ✔ New EC2 launched
- ✔ User Data added
- ✔ Apache auto-installed
- ✔ Website works without SSH
- ✔ Understood automation concept

---

## 🧪 EC2 HANDS-ON – LAB 10

### 👉 EC2 Instance Lifecycle (Start, Stop, Reboot, Terminate)

![Image](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize%3Afit%3A752/1%2Ag5rz-jln6QgHrIy-xSv7YQ.png)

---

### 🎯 Objective of LAB 10

You will:

* Perform **Start / Stop / Reboot / Terminate**
* Understand **what happens to IP, storage, billing**
* Learn **when to use each action**
* Be **interview-ready**

---

### 🧠 FIRST: EC2 Lifecycle States (Simple)

An EC2 instance can be in:

| State      | Meaning         |
| ---------- | --------------- |
| Pending    | Starting        |
| Running    | Active          |
| Stopped    | Powered off     |
| Terminated | Deleted forever |

---

### 🔹 STEP 1: Identify Two Instances

You should have:

1. `ec2-hands-on-1` (Elastic IP attached)
2. `ec2-userdata-demo`

We will **safely test lifecycle** on `ec2-userdata-demo`

---

### 🔹 STEP 2: STOP the Instance

1. EC2 → Instances
2. Select `ec2-userdata-demo`
3. **Instance state → Stop**
4. Confirm

---

> 🔍 What Happens When STOP?

| Item       | Result            |
| ---------- | ----------------- |
| Instance   | OFF               |
| Billing    | ❌ No compute cost |
| EBS root   | ✅ Preserved       |
| Public IP  | ❌ Released        |
| Elastic IP | ❌ Not attached    |

---

### 🔹 STEP 3: START the Instance Again

1. Select instance
2. **Instance state → Start**

Wait → Running

---

> 🔍 Check Public IP

* Public IP will be **NEW**
* Website still works (Apache already installed)

📌 This proves:

* Data remains
* Public IP changes

---

### 🔹 STEP 4: REBOOT the Instance

1. Select instance
2. **Instance state → Reboot**

---

> 🔍 What Happens When REBOOT?

| Item      | Result      |
| --------- | ----------- |
| OS        | Restarts    |
| Public IP | ✅ Same      |
| Data      | ✅ Safe      |
| Billing   | ✅ Continues |

📌 Reboot = Restart laptop

---

### 🔹 STEP 5: TERMINATE the Instance (IMPORTANT)

⚠️ **THIS IS DESTRUCTIVE**

1. Select `ec2-userdata-demo`
2. **Instance state → Terminate**
3. Confirm

---

> 🔍 What Happens When TERMINATE?

| Item      | Result       |
| --------- | ------------ |
| Instance  | ❌ Deleted    |
| EBS root  | ❌ Deleted    |
| Public IP | ❌ Gone       |
| Recovery  | ❌ Impossible |

📌 Terminate = Delete forever

---

### 🧠 VERY IMPORTANT INTERVIEW POINTS

- Stop → Save money
- Start → New public IP
- Reboot → Same IP
- Terminate → Data lost

---

### 🧠 INTERVIEW-READY ANSWER

> Stopping an EC2 instance halts compute billing while preserving EBS volumes, whereas terminating an instance permanently deletes the instance and associated root volume, making recovery impossible.

---

### ⚠️ COST BEST PRACTICES

- Stop unused instances
- Use Elastic IP for static access
- Terminate unused test EC2s
- Monitor free tier usage

---

### ✅ LAB 10 TASK CHECKLIST

- Stopped instance
- Started instance
- Rebooted instance
- Terminated test instance
- Understood lifecycle fully

---

## 🧪 EC2 HANDS-ON – LAB 11

### 👉 EBS Volumes (Attach, Mount, Detach & Resize)

![Image](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/ebs/latest/userguide/images/volume-lifecycle.png)

---

### 🎯 Objective of LAB 11

By the end of this lab, you will:

* Understand **what EBS is**
* Create an **extra EBS volume**
* Attach it to EC2
* Mount it inside Linux
* Resize it safely
* Be **interview-ready**

---

### 🧠 FIRST: What is EBS? (Simple Words)

**EBS (Elastic Block Store)** is:

* A **virtual hard disk**
* Used by EC2
* **Persistent** storage

Think like:

> EC2 = Laptop 💻
> EBS = Hard disk 💾

Even if EC2 stops → **data stays**.

---

### 🧠 IMPORTANT TYPES (FOR NOW)

We’ll use:

* **gp3** (General Purpose SSD)

📌 Free tier friendly
📌 Balanced performance

---

### 🔹 STEP 1: Identify Your EC2 Instance

Use:

```
ec2-hands-on-1
```

⚠️ Do **NOT** use terminated instance

---

### 🔹 STEP 2: Create a NEW EBS Volume

1. AWS Console → **EC2**
2. Left menu → **Volumes**
3. Click **Create volume**

> Fill details:

* Volume type → **gp3**
* Size → **5 GiB**
* Availability Zone → **SAME as EC2**
* Name:

```
ebs-hands-on-1
```

Click **Create volume**

📌 AZ must match EC2 AZ

---

### 🔹 STEP 3: Attach EBS Volume to EC2

1. Select volume `ebs-hands-on-1`
2. Actions → **Attach volume**
3. Instance → `ec2-hands-on-1`
4. Device → `/dev/xvdf`
5. Attach

---

### 🔹 STEP 4: Connect to EC2 (SSH)

```bash
ssh -i ec2-key-hands-on.pem ec2-user@ELASTIC_IP
```

---

### 🔹 STEP 5: Check Disk is Attached

Run:

```bash
lsblk
```

📌 Explanation:

* `lsblk` → list block devices (disks)

You will see:

* `xvda` → root disk
* `xvdf` → new EBS (no mount yet)

---

### 🔹 STEP 6: Format the New Volume

```bash
sudo mkfs -t xfs /dev/xvdf
```

📌 Explanation:

* `mkfs` → make filesystem
* `xfs` → Linux filesystem
* `/dev/xvdf` → new disk

⚠️ Formatting erases data (safe now)

---

### 🔹 STEP 7: Create Mount Directory

> Mounting an EBS volume is the process of making an attached storage volume accessible to the operating system at a specific directory path.

```bash
sudo mkdir /data
```

📌 `/data` = folder to access EBS

> ❓ Why mounting is required?

Because:

* EC2 OS doesn’t know **where** to store data
* EBS is just a block device
* OS needs a **mount point** (folder)

> 🔐 What happens if you DON’T mount?

* Volume is attached ✔
* OS cannot read/write ❌
* Storage is wasted

---

### 🔹 STEP 8: Mount the Volume

```bash
sudo mount /dev/xvdf /data
```

---

### 🔹 STEP 9: Verify Mount

```bash
df -h
```

📌 You should see `/data` mounted

---

### 🔹 STEP 10: Make Mount Persistent (IMPORTANT)

Open fstab:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/fstab
```

Add line at bottom:

```bash
/dev/xvdf /data xfs defaults,nofail 0 2
```

Save & exit:

* CTRL + X → Y → Enter

📌 This ensures mount survives reboot

---

### 🔹 STEP 11: Resize EBS Volume (Hands-On)

> Increase volume size

1. EC2 → Volumes
2. Select `ebs-hands-on-1`
3. Actions → **Modify volume**
4. Change size:

```
5 → 10 GiB
```

5. Save

---

> Extend filesystem (inside EC2)

```bash
sudo xfs_growfs /data
```

📌 Expands filesystem to new size

Verify:

```bash
df -h
```

---

### 🧠 VERY IMPORTANT INTERVIEW POINTS

✔ EBS is **AZ-specific**
✔ EBS is **persistent**
✔ Can attach/detach
✔ Can resize without downtime
✔ Root volume is also EBS

---

### 🧠 INTERVIEW-READY ANSWER

> Amazon EBS is a persistent block storage service designed for EC2 instances. It provides durable storage that can be attached, detached, resized, and snapshotted independently of the instance lifecycle.

---

### ⚠️ COMMON MISTAKES

❌ Different AZ for volume
❌ Forgetting filesystem resize
❌ Not updating `/etc/fstab`
❌ Formatting wrong disk

---

### ✅ LAB 11 TASK CHECKLIST

✔ Created EBS volume
✔ Attached to EC2
✔ Formatted & mounted
✔ Made persistent
✔ Resized volume

---

## 🧪 EC2 HANDS-ON – LAB 12

### 👉 EBS Snapshots & Restore (Backup & Disaster Recovery)

![Image](https://www.edureka.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/backing-up-amazon-ec2-How-To-Restore-EC2-Instance-From-Snapshot-Edureka-1.jpg)

---

### 🎯 Objective of LAB 12

By the end of this lab, you will:

* Create an **EBS snapshot (backup)**
* Restore a **new volume from snapshot**
* Attach it to EC2
* Prove **data recovery**
* Understand **real-world backup strategy**

---

### 🧠 FIRST: What is an EBS Snapshot? (Simple)

An **EBS Snapshot** is:

* A **backup of an EBS volume**
* Stored in **Amazon S3 (managed by AWS)**
* **Incremental** (only changes are saved)

Think like:

> Snapshot = Photo of your disk 📸
> Volume = Live hard disk 💾

---

### 🧠 VERY IMPORTANT RULES (MEMORIZE)

✔ Snapshots are **AZ-independent**
✔ Volumes are **AZ-dependent**
✔ Snapshots are **incremental**
✔ Used for **backup & restore**

---

### 🔹 STEP 1: Put Test Data on EBS Volume

SSH into your EC2:

```bash
ssh -i ec2-key-hands-on.pem ec2-user@ELASTIC_IP
```

Create a test file:

```bash
sudo echo "EBS Snapshot Test File" > /data/test.txt
```

Verify:

```bash
cat /data/test.txt
```

---

### 🔹 STEP 2: Create Snapshot

1. AWS Console → **EC2**
2. Left menu → **Volumes**
3. Select volume `ebs-hands-on-1`
4. Actions → **Create snapshot**

> Details:

* Name:

```
snapshot-ebs-hands-on-1
```

* Description:

```
Backup before changes
```

Click **Create snapshot**

---

### 🔹 STEP 3: Verify Snapshot

1. Go to **Snapshots**
2. Status → **Completed**

📌 Snapshot is safely stored

---

### 🔹 STEP 4: Create NEW Volume from Snapshot

1. Select snapshot
2. Actions → **Create volume**

> Settings:

* Volume type → gp3
* Availability Zone → **Same as EC2**
* Size → Leave default
* Name:

```
ebs-restored-from-snapshot
```

Click **Create volume**

---

### 🔹 STEP 5: Attach Restored Volume to EC2

1. Select new volume
2. Actions → **Attach volume**
3. Instance → `ec2-hands-on-1`
4. Device → `/dev/xvdg`
5. Attach

---

### 🔹 STEP 6: Verify New Disk Inside EC2

```bash
lsblk
```

You should see:

* `xvdg` → restored volume

---

### 🔹 STEP 7: Mount Restored Volume

Create mount folder:

```bash
sudo mkdir /restore
```

Mount:

```bash
sudo mount /dev/xvdg /restore
```

---

### 🔹 STEP 8: VERIFY DATA RECOVERY (MOST IMPORTANT)

```bash
ls /restore
```

```bash
cat /restore/test.txt
```

🎉 Output:

```
EBS Snapshot Test File
```

✅ **Backup & restore successful**

---

### 🧠 REAL-WORLD USE CASES

- Backup before OS upgrade
- Disaster recovery
- Clone environments
- Create AMIs
- Cross-region backup (copy snapshot)

---

### 🧠 INTERVIEW-READY ANSWER

> An EBS snapshot is an incremental backup of an EBS volume stored in Amazon S3. Snapshots are AZ-independent and can be used to restore volumes or create new volumes across Availability Zones.

---

### ⚠️ COMMON MISTAKES

- ❌ Creating volume in wrong AZ
- ❌ Forgetting to mount restored volume
- ❌ Assuming snapshot is full copy (it’s incremental)
- ❌ Deleting snapshot before restore

---

### ✅ LAB 12 TASK CHECKLIST

- ✔ Created snapshot
- ✔ Restored volume
- ✔ Attached to EC2
- ✔ Mounted volume
- ✔ Verified recovered data

## 🧪 EC2 HANDS-ON – LAB 14

### 👉 Root Volume vs Additional EBS Volumes (Deep Practical Understanding)

![Image](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/images/ebs_backed_instance.png)

---

### 🎯 Objective of LAB 14

By the end of this lab, you will:

* Clearly understand **root volume**
* Understand **additional EBS volumes**
* See **Delete on Termination** in action
* Know **real-world best practices**
* Be **interview-ready**

---

### 🧠 FIRST: What is Root Volume? (Simple Words)

The **root volume**:

* Contains the **OS (Amazon Linux)**
* Is attached at launch
* Usually named:

```
/dev/xvda
```

Think like:

> Root volume = Laptop C: drive 💻

Without root volume → EC2 **cannot boot**

---

### 🧠 What is Additional EBS Volume?

Additional EBS:

* Extra disks you attach later
* Used for:

  * App data
  * Logs
  * Databases
* Examples:

```
/dev/xvdf
/dev/xvdg
```

Think like:

> Additional EBS = External hard disk 💾

---

### 🔹 STEP 1: Identify Volumes on Your EC2

SSH into EC2:

```bash
ssh -i ec2-key-hands-on.pem ec2-user@ELASTIC_IP
```

Run:

```bash
lsblk
```

> You will see:

* `xvda` → Root volume
* `xvdf` → Additional EBS
* `xvdg` → Snapshot-restored EBS

---

### 🔹 STEP 2: Check Mount Points

```bash
df -h
```

You will see:

* `/` → Root volume
* `/data` → Additional EBS
* `/restore` → Snapshot EBS

📌 Root volume mounts at `/`

---

### 🔹 STEP 3: Check “Delete on Termination” (IMPORTANT)

1. EC2 Console → **Instances**
2. Select `ec2-hands-on-1`
3. Go to **Storage** tab
4. Click **Volume ID** of root volume

Look for:

```
Delete on termination: Yes
```

📌 Meaning:

* If EC2 terminates
* Root volume is deleted

---

### 🔹 STEP 4: Check Additional EBS Delete Behavior

Click additional EBS volume:

You’ll see:

```
Delete on termination: No
```

📌 Meaning:

* Data survives EC2 termination
* Used for backups & safety

---

### 🔹 STEP 5: PRACTICAL SCENARIO (CONCEPT)

> If EC2 is TERMINATED:

| Volume Type    | Result      |
| -------------- | ----------- |
| Root volume    | ❌ Deleted   |
| Additional EBS | ✅ Preserved |

📌 That’s why:

* App data should be on **separate EBS**
* OS only on root

---

### 🔹 STEP 6: BEST PRACTICE (REAL WORLD)

- ✔ Keep OS on root volume
- ✔ Keep data/logs on separate EBS
- ✔ Disable delete-on-termination for critical volumes
- ✔ Take snapshots regularly

---

### 🧠 INTERVIEW-READY ANSWER

> The root volume contains the operating system and is required for booting an EC2 instance, while additional EBS volumes are used for application data. By default, the root volume is deleted on termination, whereas additional volumes persist unless explicitly configured otherwise.

---

### ⚠️ COMMON MISTAKES

- ❌ Storing critical data on root volume
- ❌ Not checking delete-on-termination
- ❌ Forgetting to back up additional volumes

---

### ✅ LAB 14 TASK CHECKLIST

- ✔ Identified root vs additional volumes
- ✔ Checked mount points
- ✔ Understood delete-on-termination
- ✔ Learned real-world design practice

## 🧪 EC2 HANDS-ON – LAB 15

### 👉 EBS vs Instance Store (Performance vs Persistence)

![Image](https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/C5112AQHdbOMjD6dU6Q/article-cover_image-shrink_600_2000/article-cover_image-shrink_600_2000/0/1553763162402?e=2147483647\&t=0w9H4LmD-_pxSdjsg6FK9M1mmi8DoaYMxunRRKLQMaM\&v=beta)

---

### 🎯 Objective of LAB 15

By the end of this lab, you will:

* Understand **Instance Store**
* Compare **EBS vs Instance Store**
* Know **when to use each**
* Be **interview-ready**

---

### 🧠 FIRST: What is Instance Store?

**Instance Store** is:

* **Temporary (ephemeral) storage**
* Physically attached to EC2 host
* Data is **lost** if:

  * Instance stops
  * Instance terminates
  * Host fails

Think like:

> Instance Store = RAM disk / temporary scratch space ⚡

---

### 🧠 What is EBS? (Reminder)

**EBS**:

* Persistent block storage
* Independent of EC2 lifecycle
* Backed by AWS-managed infrastructure

Think like:

> EBS = External hard disk 💾

---

### 🔹 HANDS-ON NOTE (IMPORTANT)

⚠️ **Free Tier usually does NOT support Instance Store**

So we’ll do:

* **Conceptual + console visibility**
* Real-world explanation (interview focus)

---

### 🔹 STEP 1: Identify Instance Store Support

1. EC2 → **Launch instance**
2. Select an instance type like:

   * `i3`, `i4`, `d2`

You’ll see:

```
Instance store volumes available
```

📌 These instance types support instance store

---

### 🔹 STEP 2: Understand Storage at Launch

When instance store is used:

* Disk appears as:

```
/dev/nvme1n1
```

* Must be formatted manually
* Not persistent

---

### 🔹 STEP 3: EBS vs Instance Store (INTERVIEW TABLE)

| Feature            | EBS       | Instance Store |
| ------------------ | --------- | -------------- |
| Persistence        | ✅ Yes     | ❌ No           |
| Data survives stop | ✅ Yes     | ❌ No           |
| Snapshot           | ✅ Yes     | ❌ No           |
| Performance        | Good      | **Very High**  |
| Cost               | Paid      | Included       |
| Use case           | Databases | Cache / temp   |

---

### 🔹 STEP 4: REAL-WORLD USE CASES

> Use EBS when:

- ✔ Databases
- ✔ App data
- ✔ Logs
- ✔ Backups

> Use Instance Store when:

- ✔ Cache
- ✔ Buffer
- ✔ Temporary data
- ✔ High-speed scratch space

---

### 🧠 INTERVIEW-READY ANSWER

> Amazon EBS provides persistent block storage independent of the EC2 lifecycle, whereas Instance Store offers high-performance, ephemeral storage that is lost when the instance stops or terminates.

---

### ⚠️ COMMON MISTAKES

- ❌ Using instance store for databases
- ❌ Expecting data persistence
- ❌ No backups

---

### ✅ LAB 15 TASK CHECKLIST

- ✔ Understood instance store
- ✔ Compared with EBS
- ✔ Learned performance trade-offs
- ✔ Interview clarity achieved

## 🧪 EC2 HANDS-ON – LAB 16

### 👉 Multi-AZ EC2 Deployment (High Availability Basics)

![Image](https://kodekloud.com/kk-media/image/upload/v1752860152/notes-assets/images/AWS-Certified-SysOps-Administrator-Associate-Multi-AZ-Architectures-for-Various-AWS-Services-Overview/multi-az-architecture-aws-vpc.jpg)

---

### 🎯 Objective of LAB 16

By the end of this lab, you will:

* Understand **Availability Zones (AZs)** deeply
* Launch EC2 instances in **multiple AZs**
* Prove **why Multi-AZ is needed**
* Be able to explain **HA architecture** in interviews

---

### 🧠 FIRST: What is an Availability Zone? (Very Simple)

An **Availability Zone (AZ)** is:

* One or more **physically separate data centers**
* Inside a **single AWS region**
* Connected with **high-speed private network**

Example (Mumbai region):

```
ap-south-1a
ap-south-1b
ap-south-1c
```

Think like:

> Region = City 🏙️
> AZ = Different buildings in the city 🏢🏢🏢

---

### 🧠 Why Multi-AZ is IMPORTANT?

If you use **only ONE AZ**:

* Power failure ❌
* Network issue ❌
* Fire / flood ❌
  ➡️ Your application goes **DOWN**

If you use **MULTI-AZ**:

* One AZ fails ❌
* Other AZ still works ✅
  ➡️ Application stays **UP**

👉 This is called **High Availability**

---

### 🔹 STEP 1: Check AZ of Your Existing EC2

1. EC2 → Instances
2. Select `ec2-hands-on-1`
3. Check:

```
Availability Zone
```

Example:

```
ap-south-1a
```

📌 Right now → **Single-AZ architecture**

---

### 🔹 STEP 2: Launch SECOND EC2 in DIFFERENT AZ

We will launch **another EC2**, but in a **different AZ**.

### Launch Instance:

* Name:

```
ec2-hands-on-az2
```

* AMI: Amazon Linux 2023
* Instance type: t2.micro
* Key pair: existing
* Security group:

  * SSH (22) → My IP
  * HTTP (80) → Anywhere

---

### 🔥 IMPORTANT (AZ SELECTION)

In **Network settings → Subnet**:

* Select a subnet from a **different AZ**

Example:

* First EC2 → `ap-south-1a`
* Second EC2 → `ap-south-1b`

📌 This step is **CRITICAL**

---

### 🔹 STEP 3: Launch & Verify

Wait until:
🟢 Instance state → **Running**

Now you have:

* EC2 in AZ-A
* EC2 in AZ-B

✅ **Multi-AZ setup achieved**

---

### 🔹 STEP 4: Install Apache on SECOND EC2

SSH into second EC2:

```bash
ssh -i ec2-key-hands-on.pem ec2-user@SECOND_PUBLIC_IP
```

Install Apache:

```bash
sudo dnf install httpd -y
sudo systemctl start httpd
sudo systemctl enable httpd
```

Create page:

```bash
echo "<h1>Hello from AZ-2 EC2</h1>" | sudo tee /var/www/html/index.html
```

---

### 🔹 STEP 5: Test Both EC2s

### Browser tests:

EC2-1 (AZ-A):

```
http://IP-OF-EC2-1
```

EC2-2 (AZ-B):

```
http://IP-OF-EC2-2
```

✅ Both websites work independently

---

### 🔹 STEP 6: FAILURE SCENARIO (CONCEPTUAL)

Imagine:

* AZ-A goes DOWN ❌

What happens?

| Setup     | Result         |
| --------- | -------------- |
| Single-AZ | App DOWN ❌     |
| Multi-AZ  | App STILL UP ✅ |

📌 This is **why AWS recommends Multi-AZ**

---

### 🧠 VERY IMPORTANT INTERVIEW POINTS

✔ Multi-AZ ≠ Auto Scaling
✔ Multi-AZ ≠ Load Balancer
✔ Multi-AZ = **Design choice**
✔ HA requires **more than one AZ**

---

### 🧠 INTERVIEW-READY ANSWER

> A Multi-AZ architecture deploys EC2 instances across multiple Availability Zones within a region to ensure high availability and fault tolerance. If one AZ fails, traffic can be served from another AZ.

---

### ⚠️ COMMON MISTAKES

❌ Launching both EC2s in same AZ
❌ Assuming region = AZ
❌ Thinking Multi-AZ happens automatically

---

### ✅ LAB 16 TASK CHECKLIST

✔ Identified AZ of EC2
✔ Launched second EC2 in different AZ
✔ Installed Apache on second EC2
✔ Tested both independently
✔ Understood HA concept

---

## 🧪 EC2 HANDS-ON – LAB 17

### 👉 Application Load Balancer (ALB) – Distribute Traffic Across AZs

![Image](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/elasticloadbalancing/latest/userguide/images/cross_zone_load_balancing_disabled.png)

---

### 🎯 Objective of LAB 17

By the end of this lab, you will:

* Create an **Application Load Balancer**
* Route traffic to **multiple EC2s**
* Understand **Target Groups & Health Checks**
* Achieve **true High Availability**
* Be **100% interview-ready**

---

### 🧠 FIRST: What is a Load Balancer? (Simple Words)

A **Load Balancer**:

* Receives traffic from users
* Distributes it across **multiple EC2 instances**
* Prevents overload & downtime

Think like:

> Load Balancer = Traffic police 🚦

---

### 🧠 What is ALB?

**Application Load Balancer (ALB)**:

* Works at **Layer 7 (HTTP/HTTPS)**
* Routes based on:

  * URL path
  * Host name
* Supports **Auto Scaling**

ALB is part of
**Amazon Web Services → Elastic Load Balancing**

---

### 🧠 ARCHITECTURE YOU ARE BUILDING

```
User
 ↓
Application Load Balancer
 ↓            ↓
EC2 (AZ-A)   EC2 (AZ-B)
```

---

> Network Mapping (IMPORTANT)

* VPC → your VPC
* Select **at least 2 AZs**

  * ap-south-1a
  * ap-south-1b

📌 ALB **must** be Multi-AZ

---

> Security Group

* Create new SG:

  * HTTP (80) → Anywhere
* Name:

```
alb-sg
```

---

> Listener & Routing

* Listener → HTTP : 80
* Default action → Forward to:

```
tg-ec2-hands-on
```

Click **Create load balancer**

---

### 🔹 STEP 4: Wait for ALB to Become Active

Status:

```
Provisioning → Active
```

Copy:

```

```

---

### 🔹 STEP 5: Test Load Balancer (FUN PART 🎉)

Open browser:

```
http://ALB_DNS_NAME
```

Refresh multiple times 🔄

You should see:

* Sometimes: **Hello from AZ-1**
* Sometimes: **Hello from AZ-2**

✅ Traffic is distributed

---

### 🔹 STEP 6: Health Check Verification

1. EC2 → Target Groups
2. Select `tg-ec2-hands-on`
3. Check **Targets**

Both instances should be:

```
Healthy
```

---

### 🔹 STEP 7: FAILURE TEST (VERY IMPORTANT)

> Stop ONE EC2 instance:

* Stop `ec2-hands-on-az2`

Now refresh ALB URL again 👇

🟢 Website STILL works
📌 Traffic goes only to healthy EC2

👉 **THIS IS HIGH AVAILABILITY**

---

### 🧠 INTERVIEW-READY ANSWER

> An Application Load Balancer operates at Layer 7 and distributes HTTP/HTTPS traffic across multiple targets in different Availability Zones. It uses health checks to route traffic only to healthy instances, ensuring high availability.

---

### 🧠 VERY IMPORTANT INTERVIEW POINTS

✔ ALB is **regional**
✔ ALB is **Multi-AZ by default**
✔ ALB uses **Target Groups**
✔ ALB performs **health checks**
✔ ALB does NOT host applications

---

### ⚠️ COMMON MISTAKES

❌ Not opening HTTP in EC2 SG
❌ Not opening HTTP in ALB SG
❌ Registering wrong instances
❌ Using only one AZ

---

### ✅ LAB 17 TASK CHECKLIST

✔ Created Target Group

## 🧪 EC2 HANDS-ON – LAB 18

### 👉 Target Groups & Health Checks (Deep Dive + Failure Control)

![Image](https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/5b384ce32d8cdef02bc3a139d4cac0a22bb029e8/2018/06/21/pic1-1.png)

---

### 🎯 Objective of LAB 18

By the end of this lab, you will:

* Fully understand **Target Groups**
* Customize **Health Checks**
* See how instances become **Healthy / Unhealthy**
* Control traffic **without stopping EC2**
* Be **interview + production ready**

---

### 🧠 FIRST: What is a Target Group? (Simple Words)

A **Target Group**:

* Is a **logical group of backend resources**
* ALB sends traffic **only to healthy targets**
* Can contain:

  * EC2 instances
  * IP addresses
  * Lambda (not now)

Think like:

> Target Group = Team of workers 👷
> ALB = Manager who sends work only to active workers

---

### 🧠 VERY IMPORTANT CONCEPT

ALB **never sends traffic directly to EC2**
It sends traffic via **Target Groups**

📌 This gives:

* Flexibility
* Health control
* Scaling support

---

### 🔹 STEP 1: Open Target Group Settings

1. EC2 Console → **Target Groups**
2. Select:

```
tg-ec2-hands-on
```

3. Go to **Health checks** tab
4. Click **Edit**

---

### 🔹 STEP 2: Understand Health Check Settings

Default values (important):

| Setting             | Meaning           |
| ------------------- | ----------------- |
| Protocol            | HTTP              |
| Path                | `/`               |
| Port                | traffic port (80) |
| Healthy threshold   | 5                 |
| Unhealthy threshold | 2                 |
| Timeout             | 5 sec             |
| Interval            | 30 sec            |

📌 ALB checks:

```
http://EC2-IP:80/
```

If it fails → instance marked **Unhealthy**

---

### 🔹 STEP 3: CREATE A CUSTOM HEALTH CHECK PAGE (Hands-On)

SSH into **EC2 in AZ-A**:

```bash
ssh -i ec2-key-hands-on.pem ec2-user@EC2_A_IP
```

Create health page:

```bash
echo "OK" | sudo tee /var/www/html/health
```

Repeat same on **EC2 in AZ-B**.

---

### 🔹 STEP 4: Update Target Group Health Check Path

Back to **Target Group → Health checks → Edit**

Change:

```
Path: /health
```

Save changes

⏳ Wait ~1 minute

---

### 🔹 STEP 5: Verify Health Status

Go to:
**Target Groups → Targets**

You should see:

```
Healthy
```

📌 Health is now checked via `/health`

---

### 🔹 STEP 6: BREAK ONE INSTANCE (NO STOP)

SSH into **EC2-A**:

```bash
sudo rm /var/www/html/health
```

---

### 🔹 STEP 7: Observe ALB Behavior (CRITICAL)

Wait ~1 minute

Now check:
**Target Groups → Targets**

EC2-A status:

```
Unhealthy
```

EC2-B:

```
Healthy
```

---

### 🔹 STEP 8: Test in Browser

Open:

```
http://ALB_DNS_NAME
```

🟢 Website STILL works
📌 Traffic goes **only to healthy EC2**

👉 This is **zero-downtime protection**

---

### 🔹 STEP 9: FIX THE INSTANCE

On EC2-A:

```bash
echo "OK" | sudo tee /var/www/html/health
```

Wait ~1 minute

Status becomes:

```
Healthy
```

Traffic resumes automatically

---

### 🧠 VERY IMPORTANT INTERVIEW POINTS

✔ Health checks prevent bad traffic
✔ EC2 can be running but **unhealthy**
✔ ALB removes unhealthy targets automatically
✔ No manual intervention needed

---

### 🧠 INTERVIEW-READY ANSWER

> Target Groups define the backend resources for a load balancer, and health checks continuously monitor the availability of each target. The load balancer routes traffic only to healthy targets, ensuring fault tolerance and zero downtime.

---

### ⚠️ COMMON MISTAKES

❌ Wrong health check path
❌ App returns 404 / 500
❌ Health check port blocked in SG
❌ Assuming “running” means “healthy”

---

### ✅ LAB 18 TASK CHECKLIST

✔ Understood Target Groups
✔ Created custom health endpoint
✔ Modified health check path
✔ Forced unhealthy state
✔ Observed ALB traffic control

* Understand **what Auto Scaling is**
* Create an **Auto Scaling Group**
* Automatically **add/remove EC2 instances**
* Attach ASG to **Application Load Balancer**
* Be **100% interview + real-world ready**

---

### 🧠 FIRST: What is Auto Scaling? (Very Simple)

**Auto Scaling**:

* Automatically **launches EC2 instances**
* Automatically **terminates EC2 instances**
* Based on:

  * Load (CPU)
  * Health
  * Capacity rules

Think like:

> Auto Scaling = Smart system that hires & fires workers automatically 🤖

---

### 🧠 WHY Auto Scaling is IMPORTANT?

Without Auto Scaling:

* High traffic → app crashes ❌
* Low traffic → money wasted ❌

With Auto Scaling:

* High traffic → more EC2s ✅
* Low traffic → fewer EC2s ✅

👉 **Performance + Cost optimization**

---

### 🧠 ARCHITECTURE WE ARE BUILDING

```
Users
 ↓
Application Load Balancer
 ↓
Auto Scaling Group
 ↓        ↓        ↓
EC2 (AZ-A) EC2 (AZ-B) EC2 (AZ-C)
```

---

### 🔹 STEP 1: Create Launch Template (MOST IMPORTANT)

Auto Scaling uses a **Launch Template** to create EC2s.

> Go to:

EC2 → **Launch Templates** → Create launch template

---

> Configure Launch Template

**Launch template name**

```
lt-ec2-hands-on
```

**AMI**

* Select your **custom AMI**:

```
ec2-golden-ami-v1
```

📌 This ensures:

* Apache already installed
* Website ready instantly

---

**Instance type**

```
t2.micro
```

---

**Key pair**

```
ec2-key-hands-on
```

---

**Network settings**

* Do NOT select subnet here
* Security group:

  * SSH (22) → My IP
  * HTTP (80) → ALB SG (recommended)

📌 EC2 should accept traffic **only from ALB**

---

**Advanced details**

* Leave empty (no user data now)

Click **Create launch template**

---

### 🔹 STEP 2: Create Auto Scaling Group

1. Go to **Auto Scaling Groups**
2. Click **Create Auto Scaling group**

---

> Basic Settings

* Name:

```
asg-ec2-hands-on
```

* Launch template:

```
lt-ec2-hands-on
```

Click **Next**

---

> Network Settings (VERY IMPORTANT)

* VPC → your VPC
* Subnets → select **at least 2 AZs**

  * ap-south-1a
  * ap-south-1b

📌 This makes ASG **Multi-AZ**

---

> Attach Load Balancer

* Select:

```
Attach to an existing load balancer
```

* Choose:

```
Application Load Balancer
```

* Select target group:

```
tg-ec2-hands-on
```

Click **Next**

---

### 🔹 STEP 3: Configure Group Size

Set:

* Desired capacity → **2**
* Minimum capacity → **1**
* Maximum capacity → **3**

📌 Meaning:

* At least 1 EC2 always running
* Normally 2 EC2s
* Max 3 during traffic spike

---

### 🔹 STEP 4: Configure Scaling Policy

Choose:

```
Target tracking scaling policy
```

Metric:

```
Average CPU utilization
```

Target value:

```
50%
```

📌 If CPU > 50% → scale OUT
📌 If CPU < 50% → scale IN

Click **Next → Create Auto Scaling group**

---

### 🔹 STEP 5: VERIFY ASG CREATION

Go to:
Auto Scaling Groups → `asg-ec2-hands-on`

You should see:

* 2 EC2 instances **launching automatically**

📌 You did NOT manually create them!

---

### 🔹 STEP 6: VERIFY ALB INTEGRATION

1. Go to **Target Groups**
2. Open `tg-ec2-hands-on`
3. Targets → You’ll see:

   * ASG-created EC2s
   * Status = **Healthy**

---

### 🔹 STEP 7: TEST AUTO SCALING (CONCEPTUAL + OPTIONAL)

To simulate load:

```bash
sudo yum install stress -y
stress --cpu 2
```

📌 CPU goes high → ASG launches new EC2

(We can skip actual stress to save free tier)

---

### 🧠 VERY IMPORTANT INTERVIEW POINTS

✔ ASG uses **Launch Template**
✔ ASG is **Multi-AZ**
✔ ASG replaces unhealthy EC2s
✔ ASG works with **ALB**
✔ ASG = High Availability + Scalability

---

### 🧠 INTERVIEW-READY ANSWER

> An Auto Scaling Group automatically adjusts the number of EC2 instances based on demand and health checks. It ensures high availability, fault tolerance, and cost efficiency by scaling out during high load and scaling in during low usage.

---

### ⚠️ COMMON MISTAKES

❌ Using default AMI instead of Golden AMI
❌ Single AZ ASG
❌ Wrong security group (ALB traffic blocked)
❌ No scaling policy

---

### ✅ LAB 19 TASK CHECKLIST

✔ Created Launch Template

![Image](https://miro.medium.com/1%2AdTCuUnivju6cz86Vq8zZTA.png)

---

### 🎯 Objective of LAB 21

By the end of this lab, you will:

* Understand **what CloudWatch is**
* Monitor **EC2 metrics (CPU, Network, Disk)**
* Create a **CloudWatch Alarm**
* Trigger an alarm practically
* Be **interview + production ready**

---

### 🧠 FIRST: What is CloudWatch? (Very Simple)

**CloudWatch** is:

* AWS **monitoring service**
* Collects **metrics, logs, events**
* Helps you **see & react** to problems

Think like:

> CloudWatch = CCTV + Health monitor for AWS resources 📊

---

### 🧠 What CloudWatch Does for EC2

CloudWatch can:
✔ Monitor CPU usage
✔ Monitor network traffic
✔ Trigger alarms
✔ Help Auto Scaling
✔ Reduce downtime

---

### 🔹 STEP 1: Open CloudWatch

1. AWS Console
2. Search **CloudWatch**
3. Open **CloudWatch Dashboard**

---

### 🔹 STEP 2: View EC2 Metrics

1. Left menu → **Metrics**
2. Click **EC2**
3. Click **Per-Instance Metrics**
4. Select one EC2 from ASG or `ec2-hands-on-1`

You’ll see metrics like:

📌 These are **real-time performance data**

---

### 🔹 STEP 3: View CPU Utilization Graph

1. Select **CPUUtilization**
2. Click **Graphed metrics**

You’ll see:

* Time on X-axis
* CPU % on Y-axis

📌 This is what ASG uses for scaling

---

### 🔹 STEP 4: Create a CloudWatch Alarm (IMPORTANT)

Now we create an **alarm on CPU usage**.

1. Select **CPUUtilization**
2. Click **Create alarm**

---

> Alarm Configuration

**Metric**

* CPUUtilization

**Condition**

* Threshold type → Static
* Whenever CPUUtilization **Greater than**

```
70%
```

---

> Notification

* Alarm state trigger → In alarm

📌 For now:

* Choose **Create new SNS topic**
* Email → your email
* Confirm subscription from email (IMPORTANT)

---

> Alarm Name

```
ec2-high-cpu-alarm
```

Click **Create alarm**

---

### 🔹 STEP 5: Verify Alarm Status

Go to:
CloudWatch → **Alarms**

Status initially:

```
OK
```

📌 Alarm watches EC2 continuously

---

### 🔹 STEP 6: Trigger Alarm (Hands-On)

SSH into EC2:

```bash
ssh -i ec2-key-hands-on.pem ec2-user@EC2_PUBLIC_IP
```

Install stress tool:

```bash
sudo yum install stress -y
```

Run stress:

```bash
stress --cpu 2
```

📌 This increases CPU usage

---

### 🔹 STEP 7: Observe Alarm State Change

Wait ~1–2 minutes

Alarm status changes:

```
OK → ALARM
```

📧 You receive **email alert**

🎉 **Monitoring + alerting works**

---

### 🔹 STEP 8: Stop Stress Test

Press:

```
CTRL + C
```

After few minutes:

```
ALARM → OK
```

---

### 🧠 VERY IMPORTANT INTERVIEW POINTS

✔ CloudWatch metrics are **automatic**
✔ Alarms trigger **actions or notifications**
✔ ASG uses CloudWatch metrics
✔ Default EC2 metrics are every **5 minutes**
✔ Detailed monitoring = **1 minute**

---

### 🧠 INTERVIEW-READY ANSWER

> Amazon CloudWatch is a monitoring service that collects metrics, logs, and events from AWS resources. It enables real-time visibility, alarm-based notifications, and automated actions such as Auto Scaling.

---

### ⚠️ COMMON MISTAKES

❌ Forgetting to confirm SNS email
❌ Expecting disk usage without agent
❌ Setting wrong threshold

## 🧪 EC2 HANDS-ON – LAB 22

### 👉 CloudWatch Alarms + Auto Scaling (Automatic Scale Out & In)

![Image](https://miro.medium.com/1%2AL-UzFLgWPrYM9RDczxX0xA.png)

---

### 🎯 Objective of LAB 22

By the end of this lab, you will:

* Connect **CloudWatch → Auto Scaling**
* Create **scale-out & scale-in alarms**
* See EC2 instances **launch automatically**
* Understand **how AWS self-heals**
* Be **interview + real-world ready**

---

### 🧠 FIRST: How This Works (Simple Flow)

```
High CPU
 ↓
CloudWatch Alarm
 ↓
Auto Scaling Policy
 ↓
New EC2 launched
```

And reverse for scale-in.

Think like:

> CloudWatch = Sensor 📈
> Auto Scaling = Action 🤖

---

### 🧠 IMPORTANT CONCEPT

* CloudWatch **detects**
* Auto Scaling **reacts**
* You **do nothing manually**

---

### 🔹 STEP 1: Open Your Auto Scaling Group

1. EC2 Console → **Auto Scaling Groups**
2. Select:

```
asg-ec2-hands-on
```

3. Open **Automatic scaling** tab

You will see:

* Existing **Target tracking policy** (CPU 50%)

📌 Target tracking already uses CloudWatch internally
Now we’ll **explicitly see alarm behavior**

---

### 🔹 STEP 2: View Auto-Created CloudWatch Alarms

1. Open **CloudWatch**
2. Go to **Alarms**
3. You’ll see alarms like:

```
TargetTracking-asg-ec2-hands-on-High-CPU
TargetTracking-asg-ec2-hands-on-Low-CPU
```

📌 These were created **automatically by ASG**

---

### 🔹 STEP 3: Understand These Alarms

> High CPU Alarm

* Trigger: CPU > 50%
* Action: **Scale OUT**
* Adds EC2 instance

> Low CPU Alarm

* Trigger: CPU < 50%
* Action: **Scale IN**
* Removes EC2 instance

👉 This is **closed-loop automation**

---

### 🔹 STEP 4: Observe Current Capacity

Go back to ASG → **Details**

Check:

* Desired: 2
* Min: 1
* Max: 3

📌 Currently running EC2 = 2

---

### 🔹 STEP 5: Trigger SCALE OUT (Hands-On)

SSH into **one ASG EC2** (any):

```bash
ssh -i ec2-key-hands-on.pem ec2-user@ASG_EC2_PUBLIC_IP
```

Install stress:

```bash
sudo yum install stress -y
```

Run:

```bash
stress --cpu 2
```

---

### 🔹 STEP 6: Observe Scaling Activity (IMPORTANT)

1. ASG → **Activity**
2. You’ll see:

```
Launching a new EC2 instance
```

Wait 2–5 minutes

Now:

* EC2 count becomes **3**
* New EC2 automatically registered in **Target Group**
* ALB sends traffic to it

🎉 **AUTO SCALE OUT SUCCESS**

---

### 🔹 STEP 7: Verify via Target Group

1. EC2 → **Target Groups**
2. Open `tg-ec2-hands-on`
3. Targets → You’ll see **3 healthy instances**

---

### 🔹 STEP 8: Trigger SCALE IN

Stop stress:

```bash
CTRL + C
```

Wait few minutes

ASG activity:

```
Terminating EC2 instance
```

Now EC2 count → **2**

📌 Scale-in never goes below **minimum capacity**

---

### 🧠 VERY IMPORTANT INTERVIEW POINTS

✔ Auto Scaling **uses CloudWatch metrics**
✔ Alarms can trigger **scale out/in**
✔ Scaling is **automatic & continuous**
✔ No human action required
✔ Prevents over-provisioning

---

### 🧠 INTERVIEW-READY ANSWER

> CloudWatch alarms monitor EC2 metrics such as CPU utilization and trigger Auto Scaling policies to automatically scale out or scale in instances, ensuring performance and cost efficiency.

---

### ⚠️ COMMON MISTAKES

❌ Min capacity = 0 (downtime risk)
❌ Wrong metric selection
❌ Expecting instant scaling (it’s gradual)
❌ Forgetting cooldown periods

---

### ✅ LAB 22 TASK CHECKLIST

✔ Viewed ASG-created alarms
✔ Triggered scale-out
✔ Observed new EC2 launch
✔ Verified via Target Group
✔ Observed scale-in

---

## 🧪 EC2 HANDS-ON – LAB 23

### 👉 EC2 Logs & Troubleshooting (CloudWatch Logs + Real Failures)

![Image](https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/972a67c48192728a34979d9a35164c1295401b71/2019/06/07/SSLogInsights.png)

---

### 🎯 Objective of LAB 23

By the end of this lab, you will:

* Understand **where EC2 logs live**
* Send **EC2 logs to CloudWatch**
* Debug **real website failures**
* Know **production troubleshooting flow**
* Be **interview + on-call ready**

---

### 🧠 FIRST: Why Logs Are CRITICAL

Metrics tell you **something is wrong**
Logs tell you **WHY it is wrong**

Think like:

> Metrics = Fever 🌡️
> Logs = Doctor report 🩺

---

### 🧠 TYPES OF LOGS YOU MUST KNOW

> 1️⃣ System Logs

* OS boot issues
* Kernel problems

> 2️⃣ Application Logs

* Apache / Nginx
* App errors

> 3️⃣ Cloud Logs

* Centralized in CloudWatch
* Used for monitoring & alerting

---

### 🔹 STEP 1: Check EC2 SYSTEM LOG (Console Level)

1. EC2 → Instances
2. Select any EC2
3. Actions → **Monitor and troubleshoot**
4. Click **Get system log**

📌 Shows:

* Boot messages
* Startup failures

✅ Used when EC2 **won’t start**

---

### 🔹 STEP 2: Apache Logs (INSIDE EC2)

SSH into EC2:

```bash
ssh -i ec2-key-hands-on.pem ec2-user@EC2_PUBLIC_IP
```

Apache log locations:

```bash
/var/log/httpd/access_log
/var/log/httpd/error_log
```

View logs:

```bash
sudo tail -f /var/log/httpd/access_log
```

📌 Shows:

* Requests coming to server

---

### 🔹 STEP 3: Simulate an ERROR (Hands-On)

Break Apache config (safe test):

```bash
sudo chmod 000 /var/www/html
```

Now open website in browser ❌
It will fail

Check error log:

```bash
sudo tail /var/log/httpd/error_log
```

You’ll see **permission denied errors**

👉 This is **real troubleshooting**

---

### 🔹 STEP 4: FIX the Issue

```bash
sudo chmod 755 /var/www/html
sudo systemctl restart httpd
```

Refresh browser → 🟢 Works again

---

### 🧠 LESSON

✔ Website down ≠ EC2 down
✔ Logs tell exact cause
✔ Restart without checking logs = BAD practice

---

### 🔹 STEP 5: Send EC2 Logs to CloudWatch (IMPORTANT)

Now we centralize logs using **CloudWatch Agent**.

---

> Install CloudWatch Agent

```bash
sudo yum install amazon-cloudwatch-agent -y
```

📌 This agent sends logs → CloudWatch

---

> Create Agent Config File

```bash
sudo nano /opt/aws/amazon-cloudwatch-agent/bin/config.json
```

Paste:

```json
{
  "logs": {
    "logs_collected": {
      "files": {
        "collect_list": [
          {
            "file_path": "/var/log/httpd/error_log",
            "log_group_name": "ec2-apache-error-log",
            "log_stream_name": "{instance_id}"
          }
        ]
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Save & exit

---

> Start CloudWatch Agent

```bash
sudo /opt/aws/amazon-cloudwatch-agent/bin/amazon-cloudwatch-agent-ctl \
-a fetch-config \
-m ec2 \
-c file:/opt/aws/amazon-cloudwatch-agent/bin/config.json \
-s
```

📌 This command:

* Reads config
* Starts agent
* Pushes logs to CloudWatch

---

### 🔹 STEP 6: View Logs in CloudWatch

1. Open **CloudWatch**
2. Go to **Logs → Log groups**
3. Open:

```
ec2-apache-error-log
```

🎉 You’ll see Apache logs **without SSH**

---

### 🧠 REAL-WORLD BENEFITS

✔ Debug without server access
✔ Centralized logs
✔ Works with ASG (instances come & go)
✔ Required for compliance & audits

---

### 🧠 INTERVIEW-READY ANSWER

> EC2 troubleshooting involves analyzing system logs, application logs, and CloudWatch Logs. Centralizing logs in CloudWatch enables faster debugging, monitoring, and troubleshooting across scalable environments.

---

### ⚠️ COMMON MISTAKES

❌ Restarting services blindly
❌ Not checking error logs
❌ No centralized logging
❌ SSH-only debugging

---

### ✅ LAB 23 TASK CHECKLIST

✔ Viewed system logs
✔ Checked Apache logs
✔ Simulated real error
✔ Fixed issue using logs
✔ Sent logs to CloudWatch

---

## 🧪 EC2 HANDS-ON – LAB 24

### 👉 IAM Roles for EC2 (Secure AWS Access WITHOUT Access Keys)

![Image](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize%3Afit%3A1200/1%2AUqAIVS3OIZOK7guX6iP4dA.png)

---

### 🎯 Objective of LAB 24

By the end of this lab, you will:

* Understand **why access keys are dangerous**
* Create an **IAM Role**
* Attach the role to an **EC2 instance**
* Access AWS services **without access keys**
* Be **100% interview + production ready**

---

### 🧠 FIRST: Why NOT Use Access Keys on EC2?

If you put **Access Key + Secret Key** inside EC2:
❌ Keys can be stolen
❌ Keys can be leaked in GitHub
❌ Manual rotation required
❌ Security risk

👉 **AWS Best Practice**:
✔ Use **IAM Roles**

---

### 🧠 What is an IAM Role?

An **IAM Role**:

* Is an **identity** for AWS services
* Provides **temporary credentials**
* Automatically rotated by AWS
* Attached directly to EC2

Think like:

> IAM Role = Temporary ID card 🎫
> EC2 uses it automatically

---

### 🔹 IAM SERVICE (Important to Know)

IAM belongs to
**Amazon Web Services**

IAM = **Identity and Access Management**

---

### 🧠 WHAT WE WILL DO IN THIS LAB

We will:
1️⃣ Create IAM Role
2️⃣ Attach **S3 read access**
3️⃣ Attach role to EC2
4️⃣ Access S3 **without keys**

---

### 🔹 STEP 1: Create IAM Role

1. AWS Console → Search **IAM**
2. Click **Roles**
3. Click **Create role**

---

> Trusted Entity

* Select **AWS service**
* Use case → **EC2**
* Click **Next**

📌 This means:
EC2 is allowed to **assume this role**

---

### 🔹 STEP 2: Attach Permission Policy

Search & select:

```
AmazonS3ReadOnlyAccess
```

Click **Next**

📌 This policy allows:

* List buckets
* Read objects
* NO delete access

---

### 🔹 STEP 3: Name the Role

Role name:

```
ec2-s3-read-role
```

Click **Create role**

🎉 IAM Role created

---

### 🔹 STEP 4: Attach IAM Role to EC2

1. EC2 → **Instances**
2. Select:

```
ec2-hands-on-1
```

3. Actions → **Security**
4. Click **Modify IAM role**
5. Select:

```
ec2-s3-read-role
```

6. Save

📌 Role attached **without reboot**

---

### 🔹 STEP 5: VERIFY ACCESS (NO ACCESS KEYS)

SSH into EC2:

```bash
ssh -i ec2-key-hands-on.pem ec2-user@ELASTIC_IP
```

Run:

```bash
aws s3 ls
```

🎉 You should see **S3 buckets list**

📌 No access key
📌 No secret key
📌 Fully secure

---

### 🔹 STEP 6: PROVE THERE ARE NO KEYS

Run:

```bash
cat ~/.aws/credentials
```

Output:

```
No such file or directory
```

✅ Proof: IAM Role is working

---

### 🧠 HOW THIS WORKS INTERNALLY (INTERVIEW GOLD)

* EC2 requests credentials from **Metadata Service**
* IAM provides **temporary credentials**
* Credentials auto-expire & rotate

---

### 🧠 INTERVIEW-READY ANSWER

> IAM Roles provide secure, temporary credentials to EC2 instances, eliminating the need for hard-coded access keys. AWS automatically rotates these credentials, making IAM Roles the recommended and secure way to grant permissions to EC2.

---

### ⚠️ COMMON MISTAKES

❌ Using access keys on EC2
❌ Over-permissioned roles
❌ One role for everything
❌ Not rotating credentials (keys)

---

### ✅ LAB 24 TASK CHECKLIST

✔ Created IAM Role
✔ Attached S3 Read policy
✔ Attached role to EC2
✔ Accessed S3 without keys
✔ Understood security flow

## 🧪 EC2 HANDS-ON – LAB 25

### 👉 EC2 Session Manager (Login WITHOUT SSH & Key Pair)

![Image](https://blog.alexrusin.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/EC2-Instance-Connect-Cover-4-Cover-scaled.jpg)

---

### 🎯 Objective of LAB 25

By the end of this lab, you will:

* Understand **what Session Manager is**
* Access EC2 **without SSH**
* Remove dependency on **key pairs**
* Learn **enterprise-grade secure access**
* Be **interview + production ready**

---

### 🧠 FIRST: What is Session Manager?

**Session Manager** is part of
**AWS Systems Manager**

It allows you to:
✔ Connect to EC2 via AWS Console
✔ No SSH (port 22 not needed)
✔ No key pair
✔ Fully logged & auditable

Think like:

> Session Manager = Secure remote terminal via AWS 🔐

---

### 🧠 WHY Session Manager is BETTER than SSH?

| SSH            | Session Manager   |
| -------------- | ----------------- |
| Needs port 22  | ❌ No ports needed |
| Needs key pair | ❌ No keys         |
| Hard to audit  | ✅ Fully logged    |
| Security risk  | ✅ Very secure     |

👉 **AWS RECOMMENDS Session Manager**

---

### 🧠 PREREQUISITES (VERY IMPORTANT)

To use Session Manager, EC2 must have:

✔ **SSM Agent installed**
✔ **IAM Role attached** with SSM permissions
✔ Internet access (or VPC endpoints)

Good news 🎉
Amazon Linux **already has SSM Agent installed**

---

### 🔹 STEP 1: Attach SSM IAM Role to EC2

We’ll extend the role you already used.

> Open IAM Role

1. IAM → Roles
2. Open:

```
ec2-s3-read-role
```

---

> Attach SSM Policy

1. Click **Add permissions**
2. Attach policy:

```
AmazonSSMManagedInstanceCore
```

3. Save

📌 This policy allows:

* Session Manager
* Run Command
* Patch Manager

---

### 🔹 STEP 2: Verify Role Attached to EC2

1. EC2 → Instances
2. Select:

```
ec2-hands-on-1
```

3. Security tab → IAM role

It should show:

```
ec2-s3-read-role
```

---

### 🔹 STEP 3: Open Session Manager

1. EC2 Console → **Instances**
2. Select your instance
3. Click **Connect**
4. Choose **Session Manager**
5. Click **Connect**

🎉 **YOU ARE LOGGED IN**

No:
❌ SSH
❌ Key pair
❌ Port 22

---

### 🔹 STEP 4: Verify Inside EC2

Inside Session Manager terminal, run:

```bash
whoami
```

Output:

```
ssm-user
```

📌 This user is created dynamically by SSM

Check OS:

```bash
uname -a
```

---

### 🔹 STEP 5: PROVE SSH is NOT Needed (Concept)

You can:

* Remove SSH rule from Security Group
* EC2 still accessible via Session Manager

📌 This is **zero-attack-surface access**

(Do NOT remove now — concept only)

---

### 🧠 HOW SESSION MANAGER WORKS (INTERVIEW GOLD)

1. EC2 runs **SSM Agent**
2. Agent talks to **Systems Manager endpoint**
3. IAM Role authorizes access
4. AWS Console opens secure tunnel

👉 No inbound traffic needed

---

### 🧠 INTERVIEW-READY ANSWER

> EC2 Session Manager, part of AWS Systems Manager, provides secure shell access to instances without opening inbound ports or using SSH keys. It uses IAM roles and the SSM Agent, offering improved security and full auditing.

---

### ⚠️ COMMON MISTAKES

❌ No IAM role attached
❌ Missing SSM policy
❌ SSM Agent stopped
❌ No internet/VPC endpoint

---

### ✅ LAB 25 TASK CHECKLIST

✔ Added SSM policy
✔ Connected via Session Manager
✔ Logged in without SSH
✔ Understood secure access model

---

### 🏁 SECURITY ACCESS PHASE COMPLETED 🎉

You now know:
✔ SSH access
✔ Key pairs
✔ IAM Roles
✔ Session Manager (BEST PRACTICE)

![Image](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize%3Afit%3A1200/1%2AyML9ck6WsW1hloGwfnENmQ.jpeg)

---

### 🎯 Objective of LAB 26

By the end of this lab, you will:

* Understand **Public vs Private EC2**
* Create a **Private EC2 instance**
* Use a **Bastion Host** for secure access
* Learn **enterprise security design**
* Be **interview + production ready**

---

### 🧠 FIRST: What is a Private EC2?

A **Private EC2**:

* Has **NO public IP**
* Lives in a **private subnet**
* Cannot be accessed from the internet directly

Think like:

> Private EC2 = Office server inside company network 🏢
> Not exposed to the internet 🌐❌

---

### 🧠 What is a Bastion Host?

A **Bastion Host**:

* Is a **public EC2**
* Acts as a **secure entry point**
* Used to access **private EC2s**

Think like:

> Bastion = Security gate 🚧
> Private EC2 = Internal room 🔐

---

### 🧠 ARCHITECTURE WE ARE BUILDING

```
Your Laptop
   ↓
Bastion Host (Public Subnet)
   ↓
Private EC2 (Private Subnet)
```

This runs inside
**Amazon Web Services VPC**

---

### 🔹 STEP 1: Understand Your VPC Structure

Go to:

* VPC → **Subnets**

You’ll see:

* **Public Subnet**
* **Private Subnet**

📌 Public subnet:

* Route to **Internet Gateway**

📌 Private subnet:

* NO Internet Gateway route

---

### 🔹 STEP 2: Launch BASTION HOST (Public EC2)

> Launch new EC2

* Name:

```
bastion-host
```

* AMI: Amazon Linux 2023
* Instance type: t2.micro
* Subnet: **Public Subnet**
* Auto-assign Public IP: **Enabled**
* Security Group:

  * SSH (22) → **My IP only**

Launch instance

---

### 🔹 STEP 3: Launch PRIVATE EC2

> Launch another EC2

* Name:

```
private-ec2
```

* AMI: Amazon Linux 2023
* Instance type: t2.micro
* Subnet: **Private Subnet**
* Auto-assign Public IP: ❌ Disabled
* Security Group:

  * SSH (22) → **ONLY from Bastion SG**

📌 This EC2 has **NO public IP**

---

### 🔹 STEP 4: VERIFY PRIVATE EC2 IS NOT PUBLIC

Check EC2 details:

* Public IPv4 address → **None**

❌ Cannot SSH from laptop
✅ This is **secure by design**

---

### 🔹 STEP 5: CONNECT TO BASTION HOST

From your laptop:

```bash
ssh -i ec2-key-hands-on.pem ec2-user@BASTION_PUBLIC_IP
```

You are now **inside the bastion host**

---

### 🔹 STEP 6: COPY KEY TO BASTION (TEMPORARY)

⚠️ For learning only (not best practice)

On your laptop:

```bash
scp -i ec2-key-hands-on.pem ec2-key-hands-on.pem ec2-user@BASTION_PUBLIC_IP:/home/ec2-user/
```

On bastion:

```bash
chmod 400 ec2-key-hands-on.pem
```

---

### 🔹 STEP 7: CONNECT TO PRIVATE EC2 FROM BASTION

From **inside bastion**:

```bash
ssh -i ec2-key-hands-on.pem ec2-user@PRIVATE_EC2_PRIVATE_IP
```

🎉 You are now logged into **PRIVATE EC2**

---

### 🧠 VERY IMPORTANT SECURITY RULE

❌ Never expose private EC2 to internet
✔ Access only via bastion / Session Manager
✔ Bastion SSH restricted to **your IP**

---

### 🧠 REAL-WORLD BEST PRACTICE (INTERVIEW GOLD)

| Practice                 | Status |
| ------------------------ | ------ |
| Bastion in public subnet | ✅      |
| Private EC2 no public IP | ✅      |
| SSH only via bastion     | ✅      |
| IAM + Session Manager    | ⭐ BEST |

👉 **Modern replacement**:
Bastion ❌ → Session Manager ✅

---

### 🧠 INTERVIEW-READY ANSWER

> A Bastion Host is a publicly accessible EC2 instance used as a secure gateway to access private EC2 instances in a VPC. Private instances have no public IP and are protected from direct internet access, improving security.

---

### ⚠️ COMMON MISTAKES

❌ Giving public IP to private EC2
❌ Opening SSH to 0.0.0.0/0
❌ Storing keys on bastion permanently
❌ Using bastion when Session Manager is available

---

### ✅ LAB 26 TASK CHECKLIST

✔ Understood public vs private EC2
✔ Launched bastion host
✔ Launched private EC2
✔ Accessed private EC2 securely
✔ Learned enterprise network design

![Image](https://i.sstatic.net/2ihm3.png)

---

### 🎯 Objective of LAB 27

By the end of this lab, you will:

* Clearly understand **Public vs Private Subnet**
* Know **why** an EC2 has or doesn’t have internet
* Understand **Internet Gateway (IGW)** and **NAT Gateway**
* Be able to **draw & explain traffic flow** (interview-ready)

---

### 🧠 FIRST: What is a Subnet? (Simple)

A **Subnet** is:

* A **range of IP addresses**
* Inside a **VPC**
* Placed in **one Availability Zone**

Think like:

> VPC = Building 🏢
> Subnet = Floor 🧱

---

### 🧠 KEY RULE (MEMORIZE THIS)

❗ **Subnet is NOT public or private by itself**

A subnet becomes:

* **Public** → if its **route table** points to an **Internet Gateway**
* **Private** → if it **does NOT** point to an Internet Gateway

---

### 🔹 COMPONENTS YOU MUST KNOW

> 🌐 Internet Gateway (IGW)

* Allows **internet ↔ VPC**
* Required for public internet access

> 🔁 NAT Gateway

* Allows **private EC2 → internet**
* Blocks **internet → private EC2**

---

### 🔹 STEP 1: Open Your VPC Route Tables

1. AWS Console → **VPC**
2. Left menu → **Route Tables**
3. Identify:

   * Public route table
   * Private route table

---

### 🔹 STEP 2: Examine PUBLIC Subnet Route Table

Select **public route table** → Routes tab

You will see something like:

| Destination | Target   |
| ----------- | -------- |
| 10.0.0.0/16 | local    |
| 0.0.0.0/0   | igw-xxxx |

📌 Meaning:

* Local VPC traffic → allowed
* **All internet traffic → Internet Gateway**

👉 This makes the subnet **PUBLIC**

---

### 🔹 STEP 3: Examine PRIVATE Subnet Route Table

Select **private route table** → Routes tab

You’ll see:

| Destination | Target |
| ----------- | ------ |
| 10.0.0.0/16 | local  |

📌 Meaning:

* Internal VPC traffic only
* ❌ No internet access

👉 This makes the subnet **PRIVATE**

---

### 🔹 STEP 4: WHY Public EC2 Has Internet

Your **Bastion Host**:

* In **public subnet**
* Has **public IP**
* Route → IGW

Traffic flow:

```
Laptop → IGW → Public EC2
Public EC2 → IGW → Internet
```

---

### 🔹 STEP 5: WHY Private EC2 Has NO Internet

Your **private EC2**:

* In **private subnet**
* ❌ No public IP
* ❌ No IGW route

Traffic flow:

```
Internet ❌→ Private EC2
```

✔ Secure by default

---

### 🔹 STEP 6: Give INTERNET to Private EC2 (OUTBOUND ONLY)

This is where **NAT Gateway** is used.

> NAT Gateway flow:

```
Private EC2 → NAT Gateway → IGW → Internet
Internet ❌→ Private EC2
```

📌 Used for:

* OS updates
* Package installs
* API calls

---

### 🔹 STEP 7: REAL-WORLD ARCHITECTURE

```
Users
 ↓
Internet Gateway
 ↓
Public Subnet (ALB, Bastion)
 ↓
Private Subnet (EC2, App, DB)
 ↓
NAT Gateway → Internet (outbound only)
```

Used by **Amazon Web Services best practices**

---

### 🧠 INTERVIEW-READY COMPARISON TABLE

| Feature               | Public Subnet | Private Subnet |
| --------------------- | ------------- | -------------- |
| IGW route             | ✅ Yes         | ❌ No           |
| Public IP             | ✅ Yes         | ❌ No           |
| Internet access       | ✅ Yes         | ❌ No           |
| Inbound from internet | ✅ Possible    | ❌ Blocked      |
| Use case              | ALB, Bastion  | App, DB        |

---

### 🧠 INTERVIEW-READY ANSWER (VERY IMPORTANT)

> A public subnet has a route to an Internet Gateway, allowing internet access, while a private subnet does not. Private instances can still access the internet outbound using a NAT Gateway, without being exposed to inbound traffic.

---

### ⚠️ COMMON MISTAKES

❌ Thinking “public subnet” = public IP
❌ Attaching IGW to private subnet
❌ Exposing databases publicly
❌ Forgetting NAT for updates

---

### ✅ LAB 27 TASK CHECKLIST

✔ Inspected route tables
✔ Understood IGW role
✔ Understood NAT Gateway role
✔ Explained traffic flow clearly
✔ Interview-level clarity achieved

![Image](https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/fc074d501302eb2b93e2554793fcaf50b3bf7291/2021/06/16/Figure4-2.png)

---

### 🎯 Objective of LAB 28

By the end of this lab, you will:

* Understand **why patching is critical**
* Use **AWS Patch Manager**
* Patch EC2 **without SSH**
* View **patch compliance**
* Be **production + interview ready**

---

### 🧠 FIRST: What is Patch Management? (Simple)

**Patch Management** means:

* Updating OS packages
* Fixing security vulnerabilities
* Applying bug fixes

Think like:

> Patching = Regular medical check-up for servers 🩺

❌ Unpatched servers = security risk
✅ Patched servers = safe & compliant

---

### 🧠 WHICH AWS SERVICE DOES PATCHING?

Patching is handled by
**AWS Systems Manager**
(specifically **Patch Manager**)

---

### 🧠 WHY USE PATCH MANAGER (NOT MANUAL SSH)?

| Manual SSH   | Patch Manager       |
| ------------ | ------------------- |
| Error-prone  | Automated           |
| No audit     | Full audit          |
| Not scalable | Scales to 1000s EC2 |
| Needs SSH    | ❌ No SSH            |

👉 **Production always uses Patch Manager**

---

### 🧠 PREREQUISITES (YOU ALREADY HAVE THEM ✅)

Your EC2 already has:
✔ SSM Agent
✔ IAM Role with `AmazonSSMManagedInstanceCore`
✔ Connectivity to SSM

So we’re ready 🎉

---

### 🔹 STEP 1: Open Patch Manager

1. AWS Console → **Systems Manager**
2. Left menu → **Patch Manager**

---

### 🔹 STEP 2: Check Managed Instances

1. Systems Manager → **Fleet Manager**
2. Click **Managed nodes**

You should see your EC2:

```
ec2-hands-on-1
```

📌 If EC2 is visible → SSM is working

---

### 🔹 STEP 3: Patch Compliance (Read-Only View)

1. Systems Manager → **Patch Manager**
2. Click **Compliance**

You’ll see:

* Missing patches
* Installed patches
* Compliance status

📌 This gives **security visibility**

---

### 🔹 STEP 4: Create Patch Baseline (Concept)

AWS provides **default patch baselines**:

* Amazon Linux
* Ubuntu
* Windows

📌 We’ll use **default baseline** (best practice)

---

### 🔹 STEP 5: Run Patch Scan (SAFE – NO CHANGES)

We’ll first **SCAN**, not install.

1. Patch Manager → **Patches**
2. Click **Configure patching**
3. Choose:

   * Patch operation → **Scan**
   * Instances → select your EC2
4. Run

📌 Scan:

* Checks missing patches
* Does NOT install anything

---

### 🔹 STEP 6: View Scan Results

After completion:

* Status → **Success**
* Compliance → **Compliant / Non-compliant**

📌 This is used by security teams

---

### 🔹 STEP 7: Install Patches (Conceptual – IMPORTANT)

In production:

* Patch operation → **Install**
* Scheduled during **maintenance window**
* Automatic reboot (optional)

⚠️ We **won’t install now** to avoid downtime
But concept is **VERY important**

---

### 🔹 STEP 8: Maintenance Window (Concept)

A **Maintenance Window**:

* Defines **WHEN** patching happens
* Example:

  * Sunday 2 AM – 4 AM

Used for:

* Patching
* Reboots
* Updates

📌 Zero impact on users

---

### 🧠 REAL-WORLD PATCH STRATEGY

✔ Scan daily
✔ Patch weekly
✔ Patch in maintenance window
✔ Auto reboot if needed
✔ Monitor compliance

---

### 🧠 INTERVIEW-READY ANSWER

> AWS Patch Manager, part of Systems Manager, automates the process of scanning and installing OS patches on EC2 instances. It ensures security compliance without requiring SSH access and supports scheduling through maintenance windows.

---

### ⚠️ COMMON MISTAKES

❌ Manual patching via SSH
❌ No maintenance window
❌ Patching production during peak hours
❌ No compliance monitoring

---

### ✅ LAB 28 TASK CHECKLIST

✔ Opened Patch Manager
✔ Verified managed EC2
✔ Ran patch scan
✔ Viewed compliance
✔ Understood production patching strategy

![Image](https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D4D12AQG6TtWaGJFikg/article-cover_image-shrink_720_1280/article-cover_image-shrink_720_1280/0/1706547893931?e=2147483647\&t=j9dZ61rPSS5n_QVGtKjUjrxzc2rCSCvZ3ZuVzKBvv_8\&v=beta)

---

### 🎯 Objective of LAB 29

By the end of this lab, you will:

* Design a **complete EC2 backup strategy**
* Use **EBS Snapshots** correctly
* Use **AMIs** for full server backup
* Understand **backup automation**
* Be **interview + production ready**

---

### 🧠 FIRST: Why Backup is CRITICAL

Failures happen:

* Human error ❌
* AZ outage ❌
* Accidental delete ❌
* Security incident ❌

Think like:

> Backup = Insurance for your data 🛡️

---

### 🧠 TYPES OF EC2 BACKUPS (VERY IMPORTANT)

> 1️⃣ EBS Snapshots

* Backup of **data disks**
* Incremental
* Fast restore

> 2️⃣ AMIs

* Backup of **entire EC2**
* OS + software + config
* Used to recreate servers

> 3️⃣ Automated Backups

* Scheduled
* No manual effort
* Required in production

---

### 🔹 BACKUP STRATEGY (REAL-WORLD STANDARD)

| What     | Backup Method     |
| -------- | ----------------- |
| OS + App | AMI               |
| App data | EBS Snapshot      |
| Logs     | CloudWatch / S3   |
| DR       | Cross-region copy |

---

### 🔹 STEP 1: Identify What to Back Up

For `ec2-hands-on-1`:

✔ Root volume → OS
✔ `/data` EBS → App data
✔ Config → AMI

📌 **Never rely on one backup type**

---

### 🔹 STEP 2: On-Demand EBS Snapshot (Recap)

1. EC2 → **Volumes**
2. Select data volume
3. Actions → **Create snapshot**
4. Name:

```
daily-data-backup
```

📌 Use before:

* App upgrade
* OS patch
* Major change

---

### 🔹 STEP 3: AMI as Full Server Backup

1. EC2 → **Instances**
2. Select `ec2-hands-on-1`
3. Actions → **Image and templates**
4. Create image

Name:

```
ec2-backup-ami-v2
```

📌 This captures:

* Root EBS
* Config
* Installed software

---

### 🔹 STEP 4: AUTOMATED BACKUP (IMPORTANT CONCEPT)

In production, backups are **NOT manual**.

AWS provides **AWS Backup** to:
✔ Schedule backups
✔ Retention rules
✔ Cross-region copy
✔ Compliance reports

---

### 🔹 STEP 5: AWS Backup – How It Works (Concept)

1. Create **Backup Plan**
2. Define:

   * Schedule (daily / weekly)
   * Retention (7 days / 30 days)
3. Assign:

   * EC2
   * EBS volumes
4. AWS runs backups automatically

📌 Zero manual effort

---

### 🔹 STEP 6: Restore Strategy (MOST IMPORTANT)

Backup is useless without **restore testing**.

> Restore Options:

* Snapshot → New EBS
* AMI → New EC2
* Cross-region snapshot → DR EC2

📌 Always **test restore**

---

### 🧠 REAL-WORLD BACKUP POLICY (EXAMPLE)

| Backup       | Frequency | Retention |
| ------------ | --------- | --------- |
| EBS Snapshot | Daily     | 7 days    |
| AMI          | Weekly    | 4 weeks   |
| Cross-region | Weekly    | 4 weeks   |

---

### 🧠 INTERVIEW-READY ANSWER

> A robust EC2 backup strategy uses EBS snapshots for data volumes and AMIs for full server recovery. Backups should be automated using AWS Backup with defined schedules, retention policies, and regular restore testing.

---

### ⚠️ COMMON MISTAKES

❌ Only AMI, no data snapshot
❌ Manual backups
❌ No retention policy
❌ No restore testing
❌ Same-region backups only

---

### ✅ LAB 29 TASK CHECKLIST

✔ Identified backup scope
✔ Created snapshot
✔ Created AMI
✔ Understood AWS Backup
✔ Designed restore strategy

---

### 🎯 Objective of LAB 30

By the end of this lab, you will:

* Understand **real EC2 security threats**
* Apply **hardening best practices**
* Reduce **attack surface**
* Know **what AWS secures vs what YOU secure**
* Be **100% interview + production ready**

---

### 🧠 FIRST: AWS Shared Responsibility Model (CRITICAL)

Security in AWS is **shared**.

> AWS is responsible for:

* Data center security
* Hardware
* Physical network
* Hypervisor

> YOU are responsible for:

* EC2 OS security
* Security Groups
* IAM
* Patching
* Application security

📌 This model applies to
**Amazon Web Services**

---

### 🧠 REAL EC2 THREATS (MUST KNOW)

| Threat          | Example              |
| --------------- | -------------------- |
| Open SSH        | 0.0.0.0/0 on port 22 |
| Key leakage     | `.pem` in GitHub     |
| Unpatched OS    | Exploits             |
| Public services | DB exposed           |
| Over-permission | IAM * access         |

---

### 🔹 STEP 1: LOCK DOWN SSH (HANDS-ON CHECK)

Go to:
EC2 → Security Groups → Instance SG

Ensure:

```
SSH (22) → My IP only
```

❌ Never:

```
0.0.0.0/0
```

📌 This alone blocks **90% attacks**

---

### 🔹 STEP 2: REMOVE SSH COMPLETELY (BEST PRACTICE)

If using **Session Manager**:

* Remove SSH rule entirely
* No port 22 open

📌 Zero inbound access = zero attack surface

---

### 🔹 STEP 3: USE IAM ROLES (NO KEYS)

✔ IAM Role attached
✔ No access keys stored
✔ Temporary credentials

You already implemented this in **LAB 24** ✅

---

### 🔹 STEP 4: OS HARDENING (IMPORTANT)

On EC2:

```bash
sudo dnf update -y
```

📌 Always:

* Patch OS
* Use Patch Manager (LAB 28)

---

### 🔹 STEP 5: MINIMIZE INSTALLED SOFTWARE

❌ Remove unused packages
✔ Only required services running

Check running services:

```bash
systemctl list-units --type=service
```

---

### 🔹 STEP 6: SECURITY GROUP BEST PRACTICES

| Rule     | Best Practice        |
| -------- | -------------------- |
| Inbound  | Minimal              |
| Outbound | Restrict if possible |
| Ports    | Only required        |
| Source   | Known IP / SG        |

📌 SG = **First firewall**

---

### 🔹 STEP 7: NETWORK SECURITY LAYERS (DEFENSE IN DEPTH)

```
Internet
 ↓
Security Group
 ↓
NACL
 ↓
OS Firewall
 ↓
Application Security
```

📌 Multiple layers = stronger security

---

### 🔹 STEP 8: ENABLE LOGGING & MONITORING

✔ CloudWatch Metrics
✔ CloudWatch Logs
✔ Alarms

You already implemented this in:

* LAB 21
* LAB 23

---

### 🔹 STEP 9: TAGGING FOR SECURITY & AUDIT

Add tags:

```
Environment = Prod
Owner = DevOps
Critical = Yes
```

📌 Helps:

* Audits
* Cost tracking
* Automation

---

### 🔹 STEP 10: BACKUP + DR (SECURITY TOO)

✔ Snapshots
✔ AMIs
✔ Restore testing

Security is incomplete without **recovery**

---

### 🧠 REAL-WORLD SECURITY CHECKLIST (SAVE THIS)

✔ No public DB
✔ No SSH open
✔ IAM roles only
✔ Patch regularly
✔ Monitor continuously
✔ Backup tested

---

### 🧠 INTERVIEW-READY ANSWER (VERY IMPORTANT)

> EC2 security is achieved through defense in depth, including restrictive security groups, IAM roles instead of access keys, regular patching via Systems Manager, centralized logging with CloudWatch, and secure access using Session Manager.

---

### ⚠️ COMMON SECURITY MISTAKES

❌ SSH open to world
❌ Hardcoded credentials
❌ No monitoring
❌ No backups
❌ Over-permissioned IAM

---

### ✅ LAB 30 TASK CHECKLIST

✔ Understood shared responsibility

* Understand **how EC2 pricing works**
* Learn **all EC2 pricing models**
* Know **when to use each model**
* Apply **real cost-optimization techniques**
* Be **interview + production ready**

---

### 🧠 FIRST: How AWS Charges for EC2 (Simple)

AWS charges EC2 based on:

* Instance type (CPU, RAM)
* Time used (per second/minute)
* Storage (EBS)
* Data transfer
* Extra services (ELB, NAT, snapshots)

Think like:

> EC2 = Rent for a virtual server 🏠

---

### 🧠 EC2 PRICING MODELS (MUST KNOW)

> 1️⃣ On-Demand Instances

**What it is**

* Pay as you go

### 🧠 QUICK INTERVIEW TABLE

| Model        | Cost     | Risk | Use Case |
| ------------ | -------- | ---- | -------- |
| On-Demand    | High     | None | Dev/Test |
| Reserved     | Low      | Low  | Prod     |
| Savings Plan | Low      | Low  | Prod     |
| Spot         | Very Low | High | Batch    |

---

### 🔹 STEP 1: View EC2 Pricing in Console

1. AWS Console → **EC2**
2. Click **Instance types**
3. Select `t2.micro`
4. Click **Pricing**

📌 Pricing varies by:

* Region
* OS

---

### 🔹 STEP 2: Check Your CURRENT COST

1. AWS Console → **Billing**
2. Open **Cost Explorer**
3. Filter:

   * Service → EC2
   * Time → Last 7 days

📌 This shows **real money usage**

---

### 🔹 STEP 3: IDENTIFY COST WASTAGE (REAL WORLD)

Look for:
❌ Stopped but attached EBS
❌ Unused Elastic IPs
❌ Oversized instances
❌ Idle EC2s

---

### 🔹 STEP 4: INSTANCE RIGHT-SIZING (IMPORTANT)

Use:

* CloudWatch CPU metrics

Example:

* CPU < 10% always ❌
  → Instance is **oversized**

Solution:

* Move from `t3.large → t3.micro`

📌 Saves money immediately

---

### 🔹 STEP 5: AUTO SCALING = COST SAVER

✔ Scale out only when needed
✔ Scale in during low traffic

You already implemented this in **LAB 19 & 22**

---

### 🔹 STEP 6: SPOT INSTANCES (CONCEPTUAL)

In ASG:

* Mix:

  * On-Demand (base)
  * Spot (extra capacity)

📌 Production-grade cost optimization

---

### 🔹 STEP 7: SCHEDULE STOP/START (HUGE SAVINGS)

For non-prod:

* Stop EC2 at night
* Start in morning

Can save:
💰 **60–70% monthly**

Use:

* EventBridge
* Lambda
* SSM Automation

---

### 🧠 REAL-WORLD COST OPTIMIZATION CHECKLIST

---

### 🎯 Objective of LAB 32

By the end of this lab, you will:

* Understand **what Spot Instances are**
* Launch a **Spot EC2**
* Handle **interruption safely**
* Use Spot with **Auto Scaling**
* Be **interview + production ready**

---

### 🧠 FIRST: What is a Spot Instance? (Simple Words)

A **Spot Instance**:

* Uses **unused EC2 capacity**
* Is **very cheap**
* Can be **stopped by AWS anytime**

Think like:

> Spot = Traveling in empty train seats 🚆
> Cheap, but seat may be taken back

Spot is part of
**Amazon Web Services EC2 pricing**

---

### 🧠 WHY Spot is SO CHEAP?

AWS sells:

* Spare capacity
* With **no guarantee**

💰 Savings:

* Up to **90% cheaper** than On-Demand

---

### 🧠 THE BIG RISK (MUST KNOW)

❗ Spot instances can be:

* Interrupted with **2-minute warning**
* Terminated or stopped

👉 **Never use Spot alone for critical apps**

---

### 🔹 WHEN TO USE SPOT (REAL USE CASES)

✔ Batch processing
✔ CI/CD builds
✔ Big data jobs
✔ Auto Scaling extra capacity
✔ Non-critical workloads

❌ NOT for:

* Databases
* Single EC2 prod apps
* Stateful services

---

### 🔹 STEP 1: Launch a Spot Instance (Hands-On)

1. EC2 → **Launch instance**
2. Name:

```
ec2-spot-demo
```

---

> Instance Details

* AMI → Amazon Linux 2023
* Instance type → `t3.micro`
* Key pair → existing

---

> Advanced Details (IMPORTANT)

Scroll to **Advanced details**

* Purchasing option → **Spot**
* Spot instance type → **One-time**
* Interruption behavior → **Terminate**
* Max price → Leave empty (recommended)

📌 AWS will pick cheapest available Spot

---

> Security Group

* SSH (22) → My IP
* HTTP (80) → Anywhere

---

> Launch Instance

Click **Launch instance**

---

### 🔹 STEP 2: Verify Spot Instance

1. EC2 → Instances
2. Select instance
3. Check:

```
Instance lifecycle → Spot
```

🎉 You are running a Spot EC2

---

### 🔹 STEP 3: Spot Interruption Notice (CRITICAL)

AWS provides:

```
2-minute warning
```

Available at:

```bash
http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/spot/instance-action
```

---

### 🔹 STEP 4: CHECK INTERRUPTION (Hands-On)

SSH into Spot EC2:

```bash
ssh -i ec2-key-hands-on.pem ec2-user@SPOT_PUBLIC_IP
```

Run:

```bash
curl http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/spot/instance-action
```

> Output:

* Empty → No interruption
* JSON → Interruption coming

📌 This endpoint is **very important for automation**

---

### 🔹 STEP 5: HANDLE INTERRUPTION SAFELY (CONCEPT)

In real systems:

* Save work to S3
* Send logs to CloudWatch
* Gracefully stop job

Example logic:

```
If interruption notice:
 → checkpoint work
 → upload results
 → exit cleanly
```

---

### 🔹 STEP 6: Spot with Auto Scaling (BEST PRACTICE)

In production:

* Use **Mixed Instance Policy**
* Combine:

  * On-Demand (base)
  * Spot (extra capacity)

📌 If Spot is interrupted:

* ASG replaces it automatically

---

### 🧠 INTERVIEW-READY COMPARISON

| Feature      | On-Demand | Spot        |
| ------------ | --------- | ----------- |
| Price        | High      | Very Low    |
| Reliability  | High      | Medium      |
| Interruption | ❌ No      | ✅ Yes       |
| Use case     | Prod      | Batch / ASG |

---

### 🧠 INTERVIEW-READY ANSWER

> Spot Instances allow customers to use spare EC2 capacity at significantly reduced prices, with the trade-off that instances can be interrupted with a two-minute warning. They are ideal for fault-tolerant and stateless workloads.

---

### ⚠️ COMMON MISTAKES

❌ Using Spot for databases
❌ No checkpointing
❌ No ASG fallback
❌ Expecting 24/7 availability

---

### ✅ LAB 32 TASK CHECKLIST

✔ Launched Spot EC2

## 🧪 EC2 HANDS-ON – LAB 33

### 👉 Instance Right-Sizing (Performance ⚖️ Cost Balance)

![Image](https://www.nops.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Screenshot-of-CloudWatch-metrics-used-for-rightsizing-.png)

![Image](https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2019/11/26/image001.png)

![Image](https://softwareg.com.au/cdn/shop/articles/CPU_credit_usage.png?v=1707732517)

![Image](https://i.sstatic.net/VvhR6.png)

---

### 🎯 Objective of LAB 33

By the end of this lab, you will:

* Understand **what right-sizing really means**
* Use **CloudWatch metrics** to detect waste
* Learn **how to choose the correct instance type**
* Know **AWS Compute Optimizer**
* Be **interview + production ready**

---

### 🧠 FIRST: What is Instance Right-Sizing?

**Right-sizing** means:

* Choosing the **smallest EC2 instance**
* That still delivers **required performance**

Think like:

> Don’t use a truck 🚚 to carry a backpack 🎒

---

### 🧠 WHY Right-Sizing is IMPORTANT?

❌ Oversized instance → **Money waste**
❌ Undersized instance → **Performance issues**

✔ Right-sized → **Optimal cost + performance**

---

### 🔹 STEP 1: Identify a Candidate EC2

Pick:

* `ec2-hands-on-1`
  or
* Any EC2 from your Auto Scaling Group

---

### 🔹 STEP 2: Analyze CPU Utilization (MOST IMPORTANT)

1. Open **CloudWatch**
2. Go to **Metrics → EC2 → Per-Instance Metrics**
3. Select **CPUUtilization**

> Look at:

* Last **7–14 days**
* Average CPU %

---

> Decision Rule (SAVE THIS)

| CPU Usage | Meaning             |
| --------- | ------------------- |
| < 10%     | ❌ Over-provisioned  |
| 10–40%    | ✅ Right-sized       |
| > 70%     | ❌ Under-provisioned |

---

### 🔹 STEP 3: Analyze Memory (IMPORTANT CONCEPT)

⚠️ EC2 does **NOT** send memory metrics by default.

To monitor memory:

* Install **CloudWatch Agent**
* Send memory metrics

📌 In production, **CPU alone is not enough**

---

### 🔹 STEP 4: Check Network & Disk Metrics

Also check:

* NetworkIn / NetworkOut
* DiskReadOps / DiskWriteOps

📌 If all metrics are low → instance is oversized

---

### 🔹 STEP 5: Example Right-Sizing Decision

> Current setup:

```
t3.large
CPU avg = 8%
```

> Better option:

```
t3.micro or t3.small
```

💰 Savings:

* Up to **70% monthly**

---

### 🔹 STEP 6: Use AWS Compute Optimizer (BEST PRACTICE)

AWS provides **AWS Compute Optimizer**

> What it does:

✔ Analyzes EC2 usage
✔ Recommends better instance types
✔ Uses machine learning

---

> How to Check:

1. AWS Console → **Compute Optimizer**
2. Enable it (one-time)
3. Go to **EC2 recommendations**

📌 This is **enterprise-grade optimization**

---

### 🔹 STEP 7: Right-Sizing with Auto Scaling (BEST)

Instead of one big EC2:

* Use **smaller instances**
* Scale horizontally with ASG

Example:

```
1 × t3.large ❌
3 × t3.micro ✅
```

✔ Cheaper
✔ More resilient

---

### 🧠 INTERVIEW-READY ANSWER

> Instance right-sizing involves analyzing CloudWatch metrics such as CPU, memory, and network usage to select the most cost-effective EC2 instance type without compromising performance. AWS Compute Optimizer can automate recommendations using machine learning.

---

### ⚠️ COMMON MISTAKES

❌ Right-sizing based on CPU only
❌ Ignoring peak usage
❌ No monitoring after resizing
❌ Manual guesses instead of data

---

### ✅ LAB 33 TASK CHECKLIST

✔ Analyzed CPU utilization
✔ Understood over vs under sizing
✔ Learned memory monitoring concept
✔ Used Compute Optimizer (conceptually)
✔ Learned cost-performance balance

---

### 🎯 Objective of LAB 34

By the end of this lab, you will:

* Know **exact EC2 Free Tier limits**
* Identify **hidden cost traps**
* Clean up unused resources **safely**
* Set **billing alerts**
* Be **100% safe from surprise bills**

---

### 🧠 FIRST: What Does EC2 Free Tier REALLY Give?

Under **Amazon Web Services Free Tier (12 months):

> EC2 Compute

✔ **750 hours / month**

* `t2.micro` or `t3.micro`
* Linux or Windows

📌 1 instance × 24 × 30 ≈ 720 hours
👉 **Only ONE instance should run continuously**

---

> EBS Storage

✔ **30 GB total**

* Root + additional volumes combined

---

> Snapshots

✔ **1 GB free**
❌ Extra snapshots = charged

---

> Data Transfer

✔ **15 GB outbound / month**
❌ More = charged

---

### 🧠 MOST COMMON BILLING TRAPS (READ CAREFULLY)

| Trap                    | Why Cost Happens            |
| ----------------------- | --------------------------- |
| Multiple EC2 running    | Hours exceed 750            |
| Unused EBS volumes      | Charged even if EC2 stopped |
| Elastic IP not attached | Charged                     |
| NAT Gateway             | **Always paid** ❌           |
| Load Balancer           | Charged hourly ❌            |
| Old snapshots           | Storage cost                |
| Stopped EC2             | EBS still billed            |

---

### 🔹 STEP 1: CHECK WHAT IS CURRENTLY RUNNING

Go to:

* EC2 → **Instances**

> Action:

* Keep **only 1 required EC2**
* Stop or terminate others

📌 Recommendation:

* Keep `ec2-hands-on-1`
* Stop learning/test EC2s

---

### 🔹 STEP 2: CLEAN UP LOAD BALANCER (IMPORTANT)

1. EC2 → **Load Balancers**
2. Delete:

```
alb-ec2-hands-on
```

📌 ALB is **NOT free tier**

---

### 🔹 STEP 3: CLEAN UP AUTO SCALING

1. EC2 → **Auto Scaling Groups**
2. Delete:

```
asg-ec2-hands-on
```

📌 This also terminates ASG EC2s

---

### 🔹 STEP 4: DELETE UNUSED EBS VOLUMES

1. EC2 → **Volumes**
2. Delete:

* Volumes not attached to any EC2
* Old test volumes

📌 Look for:

```
State: available
```

---

### 🔹 STEP 5: DELETE OLD SNAPSHOTS

1. EC2 → **Snapshots**
2. Delete:

* Test snapshots
* Old backups you don’t need

📌 Snapshots accumulate cost silently

---

### 🔹 STEP 6: RELEASE UNUSED ELASTIC IPs

1. EC2 → **Elastic IPs**
2. If any EIP is:

```
Not associated
```

→ **Release it**

📌 Unattached EIP = charged

---

### 🔹 STEP 7: CHECK NAT GATEWAY (CRITICAL)

1. VPC → **NAT Gateways**
2. If exists → **DELETE**

⚠️ NAT Gateway is **expensive**
(~₹3–4 per hour)

---

### 🔹 STEP 8: SET BILLING ALERT (MUST DO)

> Enable Billing Alerts

1. Billing → **Billing preferences**
2. Enable:

```
Receive Billing Alerts
```

---

> Create Budget Alert

1. Billing → **Budgets**
2. Create budget:

```
Monthly cost budget = $5
```

3. Email notification → Your email

📌 You’ll get alert **before bill increases**

---

### 🧠 SAFE FREE TIER SETUP (RECOMMENDED)

✔ 1 EC2 (t2/t3.micro)
✔ No ALB
✔ No NAT Gateway
✔ Minimal EBS (≤ 30 GB)
✔ Stop EC2 when not needed

---

### 🧠 INTERVIEW-READY ANSWER

> To stay within the EC2 Free Tier, I monitor running hours, clean up unused EBS volumes, snapshots, Elastic IPs, and disable paid services like Load Balancers and NAT Gateways. I also configure AWS Budgets and billing alerts to avoid unexpected charges.

---

### ⚠️ FINAL WARNING (IMPORTANT)

AWS **will NOT stop services automatically**
Responsibility is **yours**

👉 This lab saves real money 💰

---

### ✅ LAB 34 TASK CHECKLIST

✔ Checked EC2 running hours
✔ Deleted ALB & ASG
✔ Cleaned EBS volumes
✔ Removed snapshots
✔ Released Elastic IPs
✔ Set billing alert

---

### 🎯 Objective of LAB 36

By the end of this lab, you will:

* Deploy a **real frontend + backend**
* Run backend on a **custom port**
* Use **Nginx as reverse proxy**
* Access the app via **single public URL**
* Understand **real-world EC2 app hosting**

---

### 🧠 Architecture (What We Are Building)

```
Browser
  ↓
Nginx (Port 80)
  ↓
Backend API (Node.js – Port 3000)
```

📌 Frontend served by **Nginx**
📌 Backend runs separately
📌 User never sees backend port

---

### 🔹 Tech Stack (Simple & Practical)

* **Frontend**: Static HTML
* **Backend**: Node.js (Express)
* **Web Server / Proxy**: Nginx
* **Server**: EC2 (Amazon Linux)

👉 This setup is **very common in real companies**

---

### 🔹 STEP 1: Use a CLEAN EC2 Instance

Use:

```
ec2-hands-on-1
```

Make sure:

* Instance is **running**
* Port **80 allowed** in Security Group
* You can connect via **Session Manager or SSH**

---

### 🔹 STEP 2: Install Required Software

> Connect to EC2

```bash
ssh -i ec2-key-hands-on.pem ec2-user@PUBLIC_IP
```

> Update OS

```bash
sudo dnf update -y
```

> Install Node.js

```bash
sudo dnf install nodejs -y
```

📌 `nodejs` → runtime for backend
📌 Comes with `npm`

Verify:

```bash
node -v
npm -v
```

---

### 🔹 STEP 3: Create Backend Application

> Create app folder

```bash
mkdir backend
cd backend
```

> Initialize Node project

```bash
npm init -y
```

📌 Creates `package.json`

---

> Install Express

```bash
npm install express
```

---

> Create Backend File

```bash
nano index.js
```

Paste this:

```js
const express = require('express');
const app = express();

app.get('/api/hello', (req, res) => {
  res.json({ message: 'Hello from Backend API 🚀' });
});

app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log('Backend running on port 3000');
});
```

Save → **CTRL + X → Y → Enter**

---

> Run Backend

```bash
node index.js
```

You should see:

```
Backend running on port 3000
```

---

### 🔹 STEP 4: Test Backend Directly (Important)

Open browser:

```
http://PUBLIC_IP:3000/api/hello
```

Expected output:

```json
{"message":"Hello from Backend API 🚀"}
```

✅ Backend works

---

### 🔹 STEP 5: Install & Configure Nginx (Frontend + Proxy)

> Install Nginx

```bash
sudo dnf install nginx -y
```

Start & enable:

```bash
sudo systemctl start nginx
sudo systemctl enable nginx
```

---

### 🔹 STEP 6: Create Frontend Page

```bash
sudo nano /usr/share/nginx/html/index.html
```

Paste:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>EC2 Full Stack App</title>
</head>
<body>
  <h1>Frontend on EC2 🎉</h1>
  <button onclick="callApi()">Call Backend</button>
  <p id="result"></p>

  <script>
    function callApi() {
      fetch('/api/hello')
        .then(res => res.json())
        .then(data => {
          document.getElementById('result').innerText = data.message;
        });
    }
  </script>
</body>
</html>
```

Save & exit

---

### 🔹 STEP 7: Configure Nginx as Reverse Proxy (MOST IMPORTANT)

Edit config:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/nginx/conf.d/app.conf
```

Paste:

```nginx
server {
    listen 80;

    location / {
        root /usr/share/nginx/html;
        index index.html;
    }

    location /api/ {
        proxy_pass http://localhost:3000;
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
    }
}
```

Save & exit

---

> Restart Nginx

```bash
sudo nginx -t
sudo systemctl restart nginx
```

📌 `nginx -t` → checks config (VERY IMPORTANT)

---

### 🔹 STEP 8: FINAL TEST (BIG MOMENT 🎉)

Open browser:

```
http://PUBLIC_IP
```

1️⃣ Frontend loads
2️⃣ Click **Call Backend**
3️⃣ You see:

```
Hello from Backend API 🚀
```

🎉 **FULL STACK APP IS LIVE ON EC2**

---

### 🧠 REAL-WORLD LEARNING (IMPORTANT)

✔ Backend runs independently
✔ Nginx hides backend port
✔ One clean public URL
✔ Same pattern used with React / Spring Boot

---

### 🧠 INTERVIEW-READY ANSWER

> I deployed a full-stack application on EC2 using Nginx as a reverse proxy. The frontend is served on port 80, while the backend API runs on a separate port and is securely accessed through Nginx.

---

### ✅ LAB 36 TASK CHECKLIST

✔ Backend API running
✔ Frontend served via Nginx
✔ Reverse proxy working
✔ Single public endpoint
✔ Real-world deployment experience

![Image](https://awstut.com/s3/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/11210816/soa-05-001-diagram.webp)

---

### 🎯 Objective of LAB 37

By the end of this lab, you will:

* Understand **why databases should NOT run on EC2**
* Deploy **Amazon RDS** in a **private subnet**
* Connect **EC2 → RDS securely**
* Use **Security Group chaining**
* Be able to explain **real production architecture**

---

### 🧠 FIRST: Why EC2 + RDS? (Very Important)

❌ Database on EC2:

* Manual backup
* Manual patching
* Manual scaling
* High risk

✅ **Amazon RDS**:

* Managed backups
* Automatic patching
* High availability
* Secure by default

Think like:

> EC2 = App server 🧠
> RDS = Managed database 🗄️

---

### 🧠 ARCHITECTURE (WHAT WE ARE BUILDING)

```
User
 ↓
ALB (Public Subnet)
 ↓
EC2 (Private Subnet)
 ↓
RDS (Private Subnet, NO public access)
```

📌 Database is **never public**

---

### 🔹 STEP 1: Decide RDS Engine (Simple Choice)

For learning:

* Engine → **MySQL**
* Reason:

  * Popular
  * Simple
  * Widely used in interviews

---

### 🔹 STEP 2: Create RDS Database

1. AWS Console → Search **RDS**
2. Click **Create database**

> Database creation method

* Select → **Standard create**

---

> Engine options

* Engine → **MySQL**

---

> Templates

* Select → **Free tier**

📌 This avoids billing issues

---

> Settings

* DB instance identifier:

```
ec2-app-db
```

* Master username:

```
admin
```

* Password → set & remember

---

> Instance configuration

* DB instance class → `db.t3.micro`
* Storage → **20 GB (default)**

---

### 🔹 STEP 3: Network Settings (MOST IMPORTANT)

> Connectivity

* VPC → your VPC
* Subnet group → **default**
* Public access → ❌ **No**

📌 This ensures RDS is **PRIVATE**

---

> Security Group

Create new SG:

```
rds-sg
```

Inbound rule:

| Type  | Port | Source                 |
| ----- | ---- | ---------------------- |
| MySQL | 3306 | **EC2 Security Group** |

📌 **SG → SG reference** (VERY IMPORTANT)

---

### 🔹 STEP 4: Create Database

Click **Create database**

⏳ Wait 5–10 minutes
Status → **Available**

---

### 🔹 STEP 5: Get RDS Endpoint

After creation:

* Copy **Endpoint**
  Example:

```
ec2-app-db.xxxxx.ap-south-1.rds.amazonaws.com
```

📌 This replaces IP address

---

### 🔹 STEP 6: Connect from EC2 to RDS (Hands-On)

SSH into EC2:

```bash
ssh -i ec2-key-hands-on.pem ec2-user@EC2_PRIVATE_OR_PUBLIC_IP
```

Install MySQL client:

```bash
sudo dnf install mysql -y
```

Connect to RDS:

```bash
mysql -h RDS_ENDPOINT -u admin -p
```

Enter password

---

> If login succeeds 🎉

You’ll see:

```
mysql>
```

✅ EC2 → RDS connectivity works
❌ RDS still NOT accessible from internet

---

### 🔹 STEP 7: Create Test Database (Optional)

Inside MySQL:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE appdb;
USE appdb;
CREATE TABLE users (id INT, name VARCHAR(50));
```

Exit:

```sql
exit
```

---

### 🧠 SECURITY PROOF (INTERVIEW GOLD)

✔ RDS has **no public IP**
✔ Only EC2 SG can access RDS
✔ Internet traffic blocked
✔ Least privilege networking

---

### 🧠 INTERVIEW-READY ANSWER

> In production, I deploy EC2 instances in private subnets and use Amazon RDS for the database. RDS is not publicly accessible and is secured using security group references so only the application EC2 instances can connect to it.

---

### ⚠️ COMMON MISTAKES

❌ Making RDS public
❌ Using IP instead of SG reference
❌ Running DB on EC2
❌ Hardcoding DB credentials

---

### ✅ LAB 37 TASK CHECKLIST

✔ Created RDS MySQL instance
✔ Disabled public access
✔ Used SG-to-SG rule
✔ Connected EC2 → RDS
✔ Understood production DB design

![Image](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize%3Afit%3A1400/1%2AEHJ04DgG31R6prL3J5PGXA.jpeg)

---

### 🎯 Objective of LAB 38

By the end of this lab, you will:

* Understand **zero-downtime deployment**
* Implement **Blue–Green deployment** using ALB
* Deploy a **new app version without downtime**
* Perform **instant rollback**
* Be **senior-level interview ready**

---

### 🧠 FIRST: What is Zero-Downtime Deployment?

**Zero-downtime deployment** means:

* Users **never see downtime**
* App is updated **while traffic is live**

❌ Old way:

```
Stop app → Deploy → Start app → Downtime
```

✅ Modern way:

```
Deploy new version → Switch traffic → Done
```

---

### 🧠 What is Blue–Green Deployment?

| Environment | Meaning                    |
| ----------- | -------------------------- |
| **Blue**    | Current production version |
| **Green**   | New version                |

Traffic is switched using **Load Balancer**, not DNS.

Think like:

> Two roads 🛣️
> Traffic signal switches instantly 🚦

---

### 🧠 ARCHITECTURE (WHAT WE BUILD)

```
Users
 ↓
Application Load Balancer
 ↓
Target Group – BLUE (v1)
 ↓
Target Group – GREEN (v2)
```

Only **one target group receives traffic at a time**.

---

### 🔹 PREREQUISITES (You already have these ✅)

✔ Application Load Balancer
✔ EC2 instances
✔ Target Groups
✔ App deployed (from LAB 36)

---

### 🔹 STEP 1: Identify BLUE (Current Version)

Your current app:

```
Hello from Backend API 🚀
```

This is **BLUE (v1)**.

Target Group:

```
tg-ec2-hands-on
```

---

### 🔹 STEP 2: Create GREEN Target Group

1. EC2 → **Target Groups**
2. Click **Create target group**

> Settings

* Target type → Instances
* Name:

```
tg-green-v2
```

* Protocol → HTTP
* Port → 80
* Health check path:

```
/api/hello
```

Click **Create**

---

### 🔹 STEP 3: Launch GREEN EC2 (New Version)

Launch **new EC2 instance**:

* Name:

```
ec2-green-v2
```

* AMI → Amazon Linux
* Instance type → t2/t3.micro
* Security Group → same as BLUE EC2
* User data (IMPORTANT):

```bash
#!/bin/bash
dnf install nodejs nginx -y
mkdir /backend
cd /backend
npm init -y
npm install express
cat <<EOF > index.js
const express = require('express');
const app = express();
app.get('/api/hello', (req, res) => {
  res.json({ message: 'Hello from GREEN v2 🚀' });
});
app.listen(3000);
EOF
node index.js &
```

📌 This EC2 runs **NEW VERSION**

---

### 🔹 STEP 4: Register GREEN EC2 to GREEN Target Group

1. Target Groups → `tg-green-v2`
2. Register targets
3. Select:

```
ec2-green-v2
```

4. Include → Register

Wait until status:

```
Healthy
```

---

### 🔹 STEP 5: Test GREEN WITHOUT USERS

Open GREEN EC2 public IP:

```
http://GREEN_EC2_IP:3000/api/hello
```

Output:

```
Hello from GREEN v2 🚀
```

✔ New version works
✔ Users are still on BLUE

---

### 🔹 STEP 6: SWITCH TRAFFIC (ZERO DOWNTIME)

1. EC2 → **Load Balancers**
2. Select your ALB
3. Go to **Listeners**
4. Edit HTTP : 80 rule

Change:

```
Forward to tg-ec2-hands-on (BLUE)
```

➡️ to:

```
Forward to tg-green-v2 (GREEN)
```

Save

🎉 **Traffic switched instantly**

---

### 🔹 STEP 7: VERIFY ZERO DOWNTIME

Open ALB DNS:

```
http://ALB_DNS_NAME
```

Now response:

```
Hello from GREEN v2 🚀
```

✔ No downtime
✔ No restart
✔ No user impact

---

### 🔹 STEP 8: ROLLBACK (CRITICAL SKILL)

If GREEN fails:

* Switch ALB listener back to BLUE target group

⏱️ Rollback time:

```
< 10 seconds
```

---

### 🧠 REAL-WORLD USAGE

✔ Feature releases
✔ Bug fixes
✔ Config changes
✔ Emergency rollback

Used daily in:

* FinTech
* E-commerce
* SaaS platforms

---

### 🧠 INTERVIEW-READY ANSWER (⭐ GOLD)

> Blue–Green deployment is a zero-downtime strategy where two identical environments are maintained. Traffic is switched between them using a load balancer, allowing instant deployment and rollback without impacting users.

---

### ⚠️ COMMON MISTAKES

❌ Deploying directly on prod EC2
❌ No rollback plan
❌ DNS-based switching (slow)
❌ No health checks

---

### ✅ LAB 38 TASK CHECKLIST

✔ Created GREEN environment
✔ Deployed new version
✔ Switched traffic via ALB
✔ Verified zero downtime
✔ Learned rollback strategy

---

## 🧪 EC2 HANDS-ON – LAB 39

### 👉 EC2 Failure Recovery Simulation (Crash → Auto Recovery)

![Image](https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/fc074d501302eb2b93e2554793fcaf50b3bf7291/2021/05/13/Figure-2.-Pilot-light-DR-strategy.png)

![Image](https://miro.medium.com/1%2AQqNjFvomy1ZcVnJ_y8yPrQ.png)

![Image](https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/972a67c48192728a34979d9a35164c1295401b71/2017/10/03/step2.png)

![Image](https://cloudonaut.io/images/2015/11/fig_ec2_recovery_failover.png)

---

### 🎯 Objective of LAB 39

By the end of this lab, you will:

* Simulate **real EC2 failure**
* Observe **Auto Scaling self-healing**
* Recover using **AMI / Snapshot**
* Think like an **on-call production engineer**
* Confidently answer **“What if EC2 goes down?”**

---

### 🧠 FIRST: What is EC2 Failure?

EC2 failure can happen due to:

* OS crash
* Application crash
* Instance termination
* AZ issue
* Human error ❌

❗ **Failures WILL happen**
✔ Good architecture = fast recovery

---

### 🧠 RECOVERY STRATEGIES (MUST KNOW)

| Failure Type | Recovery                   |
| ------------ | -------------------------- |
| App crash    | Restart / ALB health check |
| EC2 crash    | Auto Scaling replace       |
| Disk issue   | Snapshot restore           |
| AZ failure   | Multi-AZ + ASG             |
| Full loss    | AMI → new EC2              |

---

### 🔹 SCENARIO 1: Application Failure (No EC2 Stop)

> STEP 1: Break the App (Safe Test)

SSH / Session Manager into EC2:

```bash
sudo pkill node
```

📌 Backend app is now **DOWN**

---

> STEP 2: Observe ALB Behavior

* Open ALB URL
* Target Group → Targets

Result:

```
Instance → Unhealthy
```

✔ ALB **stops routing traffic**
✔ No user error (if multiple EC2s)

---

> STEP 3: Fix App

```bash
node /backend/index.js &
```

After 1–2 minutes:

```
Healthy
```

🎉 App recovered **without EC2 restart**

---

### 🔹 SCENARIO 2: EC2 FAILURE (REALISTIC)

> STEP 4: TERMINATE an EC2 (⚠️ Real Failure)

1. EC2 → Instances
2. Select one EC2 from ASG
3. **Terminate instance**

---

> STEP 5: Observe Auto Scaling (IMPORTANT)

Go to:

* Auto Scaling Group → **Activity**

You will see:

```
Terminating EC2
Launching new EC2
```

📌 ASG **automatically replaces** the instance

---

> STEP 6: Verify Recovery

* New EC2 appears
* Target Group → **Healthy**
* App accessible via ALB

🎉 **Self-healing successful**

---

### 🔹 SCENARIO 3: DATA RECOVERY (CRITICAL THINKING)

> What if data disk is lost?

Recovery steps:

1. Create volume from snapshot
2. Attach to new EC2
3. Mount volume
4. Resume service

📌 This is why:
✔ Snapshots
✔ AMIs
✔ Backups
are mandatory

---

### 🔹 SCENARIO 4: FULL EC2 LOSS

If **entire EC2 is gone**:

Recovery:

```
AMI → Launch new EC2 → Attach EBS → Register with ALB
```

Recovery time:

```
5–10 minutes
```

✔ Business continues

---

### 🧠 REAL-WORLD ON-CALL THINKING

When failure happens, ask:

1. Is it app-level or infra-level?
2. Are health checks failing?
3. Is Auto Scaling reacting?
4. Is data safe?
5. Do we need rollback?

---

### 🧠 INTERVIEW-READY ANSWER (VERY IMPORTANT)

> If an EC2 instance fails, Auto Scaling Groups automatically replace it and the Application Load Balancer routes traffic only to healthy instances. Data is restored using EBS snapshots or AMIs, ensuring minimal downtime.

---

### ⚠️ COMMON MISTAKES

❌ No Auto Scaling
❌ Single EC2 production
❌ No snapshots
❌ Panic instead of diagnosis

---

### ✅ LAB 39 TASK CHECKLIST

✔ Simulated app failure
✔ Observed ALB health checks
✔ Terminated EC2 manually
✔ Observed ASG self-healing
✔ Understood recovery paths

---
